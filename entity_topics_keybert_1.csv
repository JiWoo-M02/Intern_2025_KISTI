the present invention relates to ceramic articles, and more particularly to ceramic articles having properties suitable for use in exhaust after-treatment applications, particularly diesel exhaust filtration.
2. technical background
recently, much interest has been directed towards the diesel engine due to its efficiency, durability and economical aspects. however, diesel emissions have been scrutinized both in the united states and europe, for their harmful effects on the environment and on humans. as such, stricter environmental regulations will require diesel engines to be held to the same standards as gasoline engines. therefore, diesel engine manufacturers and emission-control companies are working to achieve a diesel engine which is faster, cleaner and meets the most stringent of requirements under all operating conditions with minimal cost to the consumer.
one of the biggest challenges in lowering diesel emissions is controlling the levels of diesel particulate material present in the diesel exhaust stream. in 1998 diesel particulates were declared a toxic air contaminant by the california air resources board. legislation has been passed that regulates the concentration and particle size of diesel particulate pollution originating from both mobile and stationary sources.
diesel particulate material consists mainly of carbon soot. one way of removing the carbon soot from the diesel exhaust is through diesel traps. the most widely used diesel trap is the diesel particulate filter which filters the diesel exhaust by capturing the soot on the porous walls of the filter body. the diesel particulate filter is designed to provide for nearly complete filtration of soot without significantly hindering the exhaust flow. however, as the layer of soot collects on the surfaces of the inlet channels of the diesel particulate filter, the lower permeability of the soot layer causes a gradual rise in the back pressure of the filter against the engine, causing the engine to work harder. once the carbon in the filter has accumulated to some level, the filter must be regenerated by burning the soot, thereby restoring the back pressure to low levels. normally, the regeneration is accomplished under controlled conditions of engine management whereby a slow burn is initiated and lasts a number of minutes, during which the temperature in the filter rises from about 400-600Â° c. to a maximum of about 800-1000Â° c.
cordierite, being a low-cost material, in combination with offering a low coefficient of thermal expansion (cte), has been the material of choice in diesel exhaust filtration. to that end, porous cordierite ceramic filters of the wall-flow type have been utilized for the removal of particles in the exhaust stream from some diesel engines since the early 1980s. a diesel particulate filter (dpf) ideally combines low cte (for thermal shock resistance), low pressure drop (for engine efficiency), high filtration efficiency (for removal of most particles from the exhaust stream), high strength (to survive handling, canning, and vibration in use), and low cost. however, achieving the combination of high filtration efficiency, high strength, and very low pressure drop has proven elusive with cordierite dpfs.
conventional dpf design has thus required the balancing of several factors, including porosity, pore size distribution, thermal expansion, strength, elastic modulus, pressure drop, and manufacturability. further, several engineering tradeoffs have been required in order to fabricate a filter having an acceptable combination of physical properties and processability. for example, increased porosity is often attainable through the use of coarser raw materials, the use of pore formers, and or lower sintering temperatures. however, each of these approaches is known to result in an increase in thermal expansion which can compromise the survivability of the filter in the desired application. in addition, the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the filter generally decreases with increasing porosity, thus leading to higher temperatures and more severe gradients during service.
in order to optimize a filter, the relatively fine porosity which reduces the heat capacity and thermal conductivity should be minimized because these pores can inhibit permeability. however, in order to maintain sufficient filtration efficiency and strength, relatively large pores should also be minimized. larger pores often have a poor degree of connectivity to one another which has been found to result in clogging of the pores by soot during filtration, causing an undesirable rapid increase in pressure drop with soot loading and corresponding decrease in filtration efficiency.
it would be considered an advancement in the art to obtain an optimized ceramic article, suitable for use in filter applications requiring high thermal durability and high filtration efficiency coupled with low pressure drop along the length of the filter. in particular, there is a need in the art for a ceramic article which possesses a pore microstructure characterized by a relatively high level of porosity, a relatively narrow pore size distribution, and a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion. to that end, as described below, the present invention provides such bodies and method of making them.
the present invention relates to ceramic articles, and more particularly to ceramic articles having properties suitable for use in exhaust after-treatment applications, particularly diesel exhaust filtration.
in a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a porous ceramic body having a total porosity greater than 62%. the ceramic body further comprises a controlled pore size distribution having a (dfactor) less than 0.4, a median pore size greater than 10 microns; and a coefficient of thermal expansion in the axial direction less than 10.0Ã—10??/Â° c. across the temperature range of from 25Â° c. to 800Â° c.
the inventive ceramic bodies are suitable in high temperature applications, and particularly as diesel exhaust filtration devices exhibiting low pressure drops, high filtration efficiency and good strength. to this end, in another aspect, there is provided a ceramic honeycomb body having an inlet end and an outlet end, a multiplicity of cells extending from the inlet end to the outlet end, the cells having porous walls, wherein part of the total number of cells at the inlet end are plugged along a portion of their lengths, and the remaining part of the cells that are open at the inlet end are plugged at the outlet end along a portion of their lengths, so that an engine exhaust stream passing through the cells of the honeycomb from the inlet end to the outlet end flows into the open cells, then through the cells walls, and out of the structure through the open cells at the outlet end.
in another aspect of the present invention there is also provided a method of making a porous ceramic article as described above. the method comprises the steps of providing a plasticized cordierite precursor batch composition containing inorganic ceramic forming batch components; a pore former comprising a potato starch having a having a particle size distribution characterized by dpbreadth less than 1.00; a liquid vehicle; and a binder system. a honeycomb green body is then formed from the plasticized ceramic precursor batch composition and subsequently fired under conditions effective to convert the green body into a ceramic honeycomb article. in one aspect, the resulting fired ceramic honeycomb article has a total porosity greater than 62% and a controlled pore size distribution having a (dfactor) less than 0.4, a median pore size greater than 10 microns; and a coefficient of thermal expansion in the axial direction less than 10.0Ã—10??/Â° c. across the temperature range of from 25Â° c. to 800Â° c.
in still another aspect, the present invention provides the ceramic article produced by the methods described herein.

it would be considered an advancement in the art to obtain an optimized ceramic article, suitable for use in filter applications requiring high thermal durability and high filtration efficiency coupled with low pressure drop along the length of the filter. in particular, there is a need in the art for a ceramic article which possesses a pore microstructure characterized by a relatively high level of porosity, a relatively narrow pore size distribution, and a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion. to that end, as described below, the present invention provides such bodies and method of making them.

2. technical background
recently, much interest has been directed towards the diesel engine due to its efficiency, durability and economical aspects. however, diesel emissions have been scrutinized both in the united states and europe, for their harmful effects on the environment and on humans. as such, stricter environmental regulations will require diesel engines to be held to the same standards as gasoline engines. therefore, diesel engine manufacturers and emission-control companies are working to achieve a diesel engine which is faster, cleaner and meets the most stringent of requirements under all operating conditions with minimal cost to the consumer.
one of the biggest challenges in lowering diesel emissions is controlling the levels of diesel particulate material present in the diesel exhaust stream. in 1998 diesel particulates were declared a toxic air contaminant by the california air resources board. legislation has been passed that regulates the concentration and particle size of diesel particulate pollution originating from both mobile and stationary sources.
diesel particulate material consists mainly of carbon soot. one way of removing the carbon soot from the diesel exhaust is through diesel traps. the most widely used diesel trap is the diesel particulate filter which filters the diesel exhaust by capturing the soot on the porous walls of the filter body. the diesel particulate filter is designed to provide for nearly complete filtration of soot without significantly hindering the exhaust flow. however, as the layer of soot collects on the surfaces of the inlet channels of the diesel particulate filter, the lower permeability of the soot layer causes a gradual rise in the back pressure of the filter against the engine, causing the engine to work harder. once the carbon in the filter has accumulated to some level, the filter must be regenerated by burning the soot, thereby restoring the back pressure to low levels. normally, the regeneration is accomplished under controlled conditions of engine management whereby a slow burn is initiated and lasts a number of minutes, during which the temperature in the filter rises from about 400-600Â° c. to a maximum of about 800-1000Â° c.
cordierite, being a low-cost material, in combination with offering a low coefficient of thermal expansion (cte), has been the material of choice in diesel exhaust filtration. to that end, porous cordierite ceramic filters of the wall-flow type have been utilized for the removal of particles in the exhaust stream from some diesel engines since the early 1980s. a diesel particulate filter (dpf) ideally combines low cte (for thermal shock resistance), low pressure drop (for engine efficiency), high filtration efficiency (for removal of most particles from the exhaust stream), high strength (to survive handling, canning, and vibration in use), and low cost. however, achieving the combination of high filtration efficiency, high strength, and very low pressure drop has proven elusive with cordierite dpfs.
conventional dpf design has thus required the balancing of several factors, including porosity, pore size distribution, thermal expansion, strength, elastic modulus, pressure drop, and manufacturability. further, several engineering tradeoffs have been required in order to fabricate a filter having an acceptable combination of physical properties and processability. for example, increased porosity is often attainable through the use of coarser raw materials, the use of pore formers, and or lower sintering temperatures. however, each of these approaches is known to result in an increase in thermal expansion which can compromise the survivability of the filter in the desired application. in addition, the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the filter generally decreases with increasing porosity, thus leading to higher temperatures and more severe gradients during service.

wall-flow honeycomb filters are used to remove solid particulates from fluids, such as in exhaust gas streams. fig. 1 illustrates a typical prior art wall-flow honeycomb filter 100. the honeycomb filter 100 has an inlet end face 102, an outlet end face 104, and an array of interconnecting porous walls 106 extending longitudinally from the inlet end face 102 to the outlet end face 104. the interconnecting porous walls 106 define a grid of inlet cells 108 and outlet cells 110. the outlet cells 110 are closed with plugs 112 where they adjoin the inlet end face 102 and open where they adjoin the outlet end face 104. oppositely, the inlet cells 108 are closed with plugs (not shown) where they adjoin the outlet end face 104 and open where they adjoin the inlet end face 102. such filters 100 are typically contained in a rigid housing (not shown). fluid directed at the inlet end face 102 of the honeycomb filter 100 enters the inlet cells 108, flows through the interconnecting porous walls 106 and into the outlet cells 110, and exits the honeycomb filter 100 at the outlet end face 104.
in a typical cell structure, each inlet cell 108 is bordered on one or more sides by outlet cells 110, and vice versa. the inlet and outlet cells 108, 110 may have a square cross-section as shown in fig. 1 or may have other cell geometry, e.g., rectangle, triangle, hexagon, octagon, etc. diesel particulate filters are typically made of ceramic materials, such as cordierite, aluminum titanate, or silicon carbide. for diesel particulate filtration, honeycomb filters having cellular densities between about 10 and 300 cells/in2 (about 1.5 to 46.5 cells/cm2), more typically between about 100 and 200 cells/in2 (about 15.5 to 31 cells/cm2), are considered useful in providing sufficient thin wall surface area in a compact structure. wall thicknesses can vary upwards from the minimum dimension providing structural integrity of about 0.002 in. (about 0.05 mm), but are generally less than about 0.060 in. (1.5 mm) to minimize filter volume. a range of between about 0.010 and 0.030 in (about 0.25 and 0.76 mm) is most often selected for ceramic materials such as cordierite, aluminum titanate, and silicon carbide at the preferred cellular densities.
when particulates, such as soot found in exhaust gas, flow through the interconnecting porous walls 106 of the honeycomb filter 100, a portion of the particulates in the fluid flow stream is retained on or in the interconnecting porous walls 106. the efficiency of the honeycomb filter 100 is related to the effectiveness of the interconnecting porous walls 106 in filtering the particulates from the fluid. filtration efficiencies up to, or in excess of, 90% by weight of the particulates can be achieved with honeycomb filters having properties such as described above. however, filtration efficiency or integrity of a honeycomb filter can be compromised by manufacturing defects such as holes, cracks, or fissures. such defects allow the fluid to pass through the filter without proper filtration. thus, in the production of honeycomb filters for applications such as diesel particulate filtration, it may be desirable to test the honeycomb filters for the presence of such defects that may affect filtration efficiency. honeycombs with detected defects may be repaired, or if irreparable, discarded.
u.s. patent application publication no. 2003/0112437 (enomoto et al.) discloses a method of detecting defects in a diesel particulate filter using a particulate, such as smoke. the method involves generating particulates and directing them at an inlet end face of the filter such that the particulates enter the filter. cells having defects readily allow the particulates inside them to flow into the adjacent cells or through the defective plugs. thus, numerous, typically larger, particulates emerge at the outlet end face of the honeycomb filter from cells/plugs having defects. a light source, such as a laser source, is positioned to emit light such that the light passes in the vicinity of the filter to irradiate the particulates emerging therefrom. a camera is installed above the filter to photograph reflected beams generated by particulates intersecting the light. brighter spots in the photographed image correspond to cells/plugs containing defects.
enomoto et al. discloses, in fig. 1 thereof, a particulate inlet 6 for providing particulates to the inlet end face of the filter 20. the particulate inlet 6 is a pipe which has the same dimension as the filter and is axially aligned with the filter. when the particulate flows through the pipe, the flow of the particulate fluid near the wall of the pipe may be retarded relative to the flow of the particulate fluid at the center of the pipe due to fluid flow phenomena, thereby possibly leading to cells closer to the periphery of the honeycomb filter receiving less particulates than cells farther away from the periphery of the filter. during testing, defective cells that offer lower resistance to flow will allow more particulates per unit time and larger particulates to pass through them, thereby providing an indication (as between the laser light and the particulates). if a defective cell is starved of flow, and, thus, particulates at the inlet end face, the brightness of the spot indication produced by such a defective cell would be weakened relative to the cells not so starved. accordingly, such cells would not indicate a defect (or indicate it less dramatically) because of being starved of particulates, even though it is a defective cell.
from the foregoing, there is a desire to avoid ambiguity in test results, particularly at or near the periphery of the tested honeycomb filter.
in one aspect, the invention is a system for detecting defects in a honeycomb body which comprises a fixture adapted to hold the honeycomb body; a particulate fluid source; a pipe which defines a flow path for particulate fluid between the particulate fluid source and a first end face of the honeycomb body, and a flow straightener including a plurality of vanes disposed in the flow path. when the particulate fluid emerges at a second end face of the honeycomb body, the emerging particles may then be detected by, for example, illumination to identify defects (in walls or plugs) in the honeycomb body. the flow straightener disposed in the flow path minimizes boundary layer influence of the pipe on the flow of the particulate fluid therein. as used herein, the term ?œparticulate fluid??refers to a suspension of solid or liquid particulates in a gaseous medium. preferably, the particulate fluid is a fog including water particles.
according to another aspect, the invention is an apparatus for applying particulate fluid across an end face of a honeycomb body which comprises a particulate fluid source having a housing with an interior cavity, and a particulate generator which produces particulate fluid; a pipe disposed in the housing and having a first end open to the interior cavity and a second end open to an exterior of the housing wherein a pressure differential drives particulate fluid into the pipe; and a flow straightener comprising a plurality of flow vanes is disposed in the pipe.

in one aspect, the invention is a system for detecting defects in a honeycomb body which comprises a fixture adapted to hold the honeycomb body; a particulate fluid source; a pipe which defines a flow path for particulate fluid between the particulate fluid source and a first end face of the honeycomb body, and a flow straightener including a plurality of vanes disposed in the flow path. when the particulate fluid emerges at a second end face of the honeycomb body, the emerging particles may then be detected by, for example, illumination to identify defects (in walls or plugs) in the honeycomb body. the flow straightener disposed in the flow path minimizes boundary layer influence of the pipe on the flow of the particulate fluid therein. as used herein, the term ?œparticulate fluid??refers to a suspension of solid or liquid particulates in a gaseous medium. preferably, the particulate fluid is a fog including water particles.

wall-flow honeycomb filters are used to remove solid particulates from fluids, such as in exhaust gas streams. fig. 1 illustrates a typical prior art wall-flow honeycomb filter 100. the honeycomb filter 100 has an inlet end face 102, an outlet end face 104, and an array of interconnecting porous walls 106 extending longitudinally from the inlet end face 102 to the outlet end face 104. the interconnecting porous walls 106 define a grid of inlet cells 108 and outlet cells 110. the outlet cells 110 are closed with plugs 112 where they adjoin the inlet end face 102 and open where they adjoin the outlet end face 104. oppositely, the inlet cells 108 are closed with plugs (not shown) where they adjoin the outlet end face 104 and open where they adjoin the inlet end face 102. such filters 100 are typically contained in a rigid housing (not shown). fluid directed at the inlet end face 102 of the honeycomb filter 100 enters the inlet cells 108, flows through the interconnecting porous walls 106 and into the outlet cells 110, and exits the honeycomb filter 100 at the outlet end face 104.
in a typical cell structure, each inlet cell 108 is bordered on one or more sides by outlet cells 110, and vice versa. the inlet and outlet cells 108, 110 may have a square cross-section as shown in fig. 1 or may have other cell geometry, e.g., rectangle, triangle, hexagon, octagon, etc. diesel particulate filters are typically made of ceramic materials, such as cordierite, aluminum titanate, or silicon carbide. for diesel particulate filtration, honeycomb filters having cellular densities between about 10 and 300 cells/in2 (about 1.5 to 46.5 cells/cm2), more typically between about 100 and 200 cells/in2 (about 15.5 to 31 cells/cm2), are considered useful in providing sufficient thin wall surface area in a compact structure. wall thicknesses can vary upwards from the minimum dimension providing structural integrity of about 0.002 in. (about 0.05 mm), but are generally less than about 0.060 in. (1.5 mm) to minimize filter volume. a range of between about 0.010 and 0.030 in (about 0.25 and 0.76 mm) is most often selected for ceramic materials such as cordierite, aluminum titanate, and silicon carbide at the preferred cellular densities.
when particulates, such as soot found in exhaust gas, flow through the interconnecting porous walls 106 of the honeycomb filter 100, a portion of the particulates in the fluid flow stream is retained on or in the interconnecting porous walls 106. the efficiency of the honeycomb filter 100 is related to the effectiveness of the interconnecting porous walls 106 in filtering the particulates from the fluid. filtration efficiencies up to, or in excess of, 90% by weight of the particulates can be achieved with honeycomb filters having properties such as described above. however, filtration efficiency or integrity of a honeycomb filter can be compromised by manufacturing defects such as holes, cracks, or fissures. such defects allow the fluid to pass through the filter without proper filtration. thus, in the production of honeycomb filters for applications such as diesel particulate filtration, it may be desirable to test the honeycomb filters for the presence of such defects that may affect filtration efficiency. honeycombs with detected defects may be repaired, or if irreparable, discarded.
u.s. patent application publication no. 2003/0112437 (enomoto et al.) discloses a method of detecting defects in a diesel particulate filter using a particulate, such as smoke. the method involves generating particulates and directing them at an inlet end face of the filter such that the particulates enter the filter. cells having defects readily allow the particulates inside them to flow into the adjacent cells or through the defective plugs. thus, numerous, typically larger, particulates emerge at the outlet end face of the honeycomb filter from cells/plugs having defects. a light source, such as a laser source, is positioned to emit light such that the light passes in the vicinity of the filter to irradiate the particulates emerging therefrom. a camera is installed above the filter to photograph reflected beams generated by particulates intersecting the light. brighter spots in the photographed image correspond to cells/plugs containing defects.
enomoto et al. discloses, in fig. 1 thereof, a particulate inlet 6 for providing particulates to the inlet end face of the filter 20. the particulate inlet 6 is a pipe which has the same dimension as the filter and is axially aligned with the filter. when the particulate flows through the pipe, the flow of the particulate fluid near the wall of the pipe may be retarded relative to the flow of the particulate fluid at the center of the pipe due to fluid flow phenomena, thereby possibly leading to cells closer to the periphery of the honeycomb filter receiving less particulates than cells farther away from the periphery of the filter. during testing, defective cells that offer lower resistance to flow will allow more particulates per unit time and larger particulates to pass through them, thereby providing an indication (as between the laser light and the particulates). if a defective cell is starved of flow, and, thus, particulates at the inlet end face, the brightness of the spot indication produced by such a defective cell would be weakened relative to the cells not so starved. accordingly, such cells would not indicate a defect (or indicate it less dramatically) because of being starved of particulates, even though it is a defective cell.

2. technical background
recently, much interest has been directed towards the diesel engine due to its fuel efficiency, durability and economical aspects. however, diesel emissions have been scrutinized both in the united states and europe, for their possibly harmful effects. as such, stricter environmental regulations will likely require diesel engines to be held to similar standards as gasoline engines. therefore, diesel engine manufacturers and emission-control companies are working to achieve a diesel engine which is faster, cleaner and meets stringent emissions requirements under all operating conditions with minimal cost to the consumer.
one of the biggest challenges in lowering diesel emissions is controlling the levels of diesel particulate material present in the diesel exhaust stream. diesel particulate material consists mainly of carbon soot. one way of removing the carbon soot from the diesel exhaust is through the use of diesel traps (otherwise referred to as ?œwall-flow filters??or ?œdiesel particulate filters??. diesel particulate filters capture the soot in the diesel exhaust on or in the porous walls of the filter body. the diesel particulate filter is designed to provide for nearly complete filtration of soot without significantly hindering the exhaust flow. however, as the layer of soot collects in the inlet channels of the diesel particulate filter, the lower permeability of the soot layer causes a gradual rise in the back pressure of the filter against the engine, causing the engine to work harder. thus, once the carbon soot in the filter has accumulated to some level, the filter must be regenerated by burning out the soot, thereby restoring the back pressure again to low levels. normally, this regeneration is accomplished under controlled conditions of engine management whereby a slow burn is initiated which lasts for a number of minutes, during which the temperature in the filter rises from a lower operational temperature to a maximum temperature.
cordierite, being a low-cost material, in combination with offering a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion (cte), has been the material of choice in diesel exhaust filtration. to that end, porous cordierite ceramic filters of the wall-flow type have been utilized for the removal of particles in the exhaust stream from some diesel engines since the early 1980s. a diesel particulate filter (dpf) ideally should combine low cte (for thermal shock resistance), low pressure drop (for fuel efficiency), high filtration efficiency (for high removal of particles from the exhaust stream), high strength (to survive handling, canning, and vibration in use), and low cost. however, achieving this combination of features has proven elusive with cordierite dpfs.
thus, dpf design requires the balancing of several properties, including porosity, pore size distribution, thermal expansion, strength, elastic modulus, pressure drop, and manufacturability. further, several engineering tradeoffs have been required in order to fabricate a filter having an acceptable combination of physical properties and processability. for example, increased porosity is often attainable through the use of coarser raw materials, the use of pore forming agents, and or lower sintering temperatures. however, each of these may result in an increase in thermal expansion which may compromise the survivability of the filter in use.
thus, it would be considered a significant advancement in the art to obtain optimized ceramic honeycomb articles, made of cordierite which are suitable for use in filter applications and which exhibit high thermal durability and high filtration efficiency coupled with low pressure drop across the filter. in particular, there is a recognized need in the art for cordierite ceramic honeycomb articles which possess desirable combinations of porosity, relatively narrow pore size distribution, and relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion (cte). to that end, as described below, the present invention provides such cordierite honeycomb articles and methods of manufacturing therefor.
the present invention relates to ceramic honeycomb articles, and more particularly to cordierite-containing ceramic honeycomb articles having properties suitable for use in exhaust after-treatment applications; particularly in diesel exhaust filtration.
in a first aspect of the present invention, a porous ceramic honeycomb article is provided having a novel combination of volume percent porosity and pore size distribution. specifically, the article comprises less than 54% total porosity, a d10 pore diameter of not less than 8 Î¼m, a d90 pore diameter of not greater than 35 Î¼m, and a value of df=(d50?’d10)/d50 of less than or equal to 0.50. according to certain embodiments, the total porosity is greater than or equal to 40%. the inventive article is especially suitable for use as a wall-flow diesel particulate filter, wherein the inventive pore microstructure provides low clean and soot-loaded pressure drop in the catalyzed or non-catalyzed state, high filtration efficiency, and high strength.
the inventive ceramic honeycomb articles of the invention are suitable for use in high temperature applications, and are particularly suitable for use as diesel exhaust filtration devices because they exhibit low pressure drops, high filtration efficiency and good strength. to this end, in another aspect, there is provided a ceramic honeycomb article exhibiting the structure of a filter and having an inlet end and an outlet end, a multiplicity of cells extending from the inlet end to the outlet end, the cells having porous walls, wherein part of the total number of cells at the inlet end are plugged along a portion of their lengths, and the remaining part of the cells that are open at the inlet end are preferably plugged at the outlet end along a portion of their lengths, so that an engine exhaust stream passing through the cells of the honeycomb from the inlet end to the outlet end flows into the open cells, then through the cells walls, and out of the article through the open cells at the outlet end.
in another aspect of the present invention, a method for manufacturing a porous ceramic honeycomb article, as described above, is provided. the method comprises the steps of providing a plasticized cordierite precursor batch composition containing inorganic batch components; an optional pore former; a liquid vehicle; and a binder. a honeycomb green body is then formed from the plasticized ceramic precursor batch composition and subsequently fired under conditions effective to convert the green body into a ceramic honeycomb article containing cordierite. in one aspect, the resulting fired ceramic honeycomb article has a total porosity of less than 54%. in a further aspect, the honeycomb article exhibits a narrow pore size distribution characterized by a d10 pore diameter of not less than 8 Î¼m, a d90 pore diameter of not greater than 35 Î¼m, and a value of df=(d50?’d10)/d50 of less than or equal to 0.50.
also provided is a method for manufacturing the inventive article comprising certain combinations of raw materials and heating rates that satisfy the relation p10??8.5, where p10 is defined as p10=3.503[log10(hr1)]+3.106[log10(hr2)]+0.00446[(wt % talc sources)(d50 talc sources)]+0.00497[(wt % silica-forming sources)(d50 silica-forming sources)]+0.00857[(wt % alumina-forming sources)(d50 alumina-forming sources)]??.062(wt % kaolin sources)+0.264(wt % pore formers)??.0147[(wt % kaolin sources)(wt % pore formers)], in which hr1 is the heating rate from 1200-1300Â° c. in Â° c./hr and hr2 is the heating rate from 1300-1360Â° c. in Â° c./hr. the weighted average median particle diameter of the talc is not more than 35 Î¼m and the weighted average median particle diameter of the silica-forming sources is not more than 35 Î¼m.
according to embodiments of the present invention, the combination of a total porosity of at least 40% and a d10 pore diameter of at least 8 Î¼m produces a high permeability and thereby provides a low pressure drop for the clean filter. furthermore, the combination of a total porosity less than 54% and a d90 pore diameter of not more than 35 Î¼m provides high strength to the honeycomb body, and also provides a high filtration efficiency to the particulate filter. additionally, the combination of a total porosity of greater than or equal to 40% and a value of df=(d50?’d10)/d50 of less than or equal to 0.50 provides a low pressure drop for the diesel particulate filter in a soot-loaded state. this unique combination of properties relating to the pore microstructure thus provides a very desirable combination of low clean pressure drop, low soot-loaded pressure drop, high filtration efficiency, and high strength, and has not been previously demonstrated in the prior art. the narrow pore size distribution provided by the present inventive bodies is especially beneficial when the article is used as a catalyzed diesel particulate filter, because a narrow pore size distribution promotes a more uniform distribution of the catalyst on the surfaces of the pore walls. a more uniform thickness of the catalyst coating on the pore walls provides a low clean and soot-loaded pressure drop, and also provides for greater contact between the catalyst and the soot and the catalyst and the exhaust gas, thereby promoting a more efficient use of the catalyst.
furthermore, according to many embodiments of the invention, the method for manufacturing the ceramic article either does not require a pore former, or utilizes commercially available pore formers, such as graphite or polymer beads, which, unlike some natural organic pore formers, are readily available in large quantities and are of a controlled and reproducible particle size.
additional aspects of the invention will be set forth, in part, in the detailed description, figures and any claims which follow, and in part will be derived from the detailed description, or can be learned by practice of the invention. it is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as disclosed.",1,problem,diesel emissions,1.0,exact,1

thus, dpf design requires the balancing of several properties, including porosity, pore size distribution, thermal expansion, strength, elastic modulus, pressure drop, and manufacturability. further, several engineering tradeoffs have been required in order to fabricate a filter having an acceptable combination of physical properties and processability. for example, increased porosity is often attainable through the use of coarser raw materials, the use of pore forming agents, and or lower sintering temperatures. however, each of these may result in an increase in thermal expansion which may compromise the survivability of the filter in use.
thus, it would be considered a significant advancement in the art to obtain optimized ceramic honeycomb articles, made of cordierite which are suitable for use in filter applications and which exhibit high thermal durability and high filtration efficiency coupled with low pressure drop across the filter. in particular, there is a recognized need in the art for cordierite ceramic honeycomb articles which possess desirable combinations of porosity, relatively narrow pore size distribution, and relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion (cte). to that end, as described below, the present invention provides such cordierite honeycomb articles and methods of manufacturing therefor.
the present invention relates to ceramic honeycomb articles, and more particularly to cordierite-containing ceramic honeycomb articles having properties suitable for use in exhaust after-treatment applications; particularly in diesel exhaust filtration.
in a first aspect of the present invention, a porous ceramic honeycomb article is provided having a novel combination of volume percent porosity and pore size distribution. specifically, the article comprises less than 54% total porosity, a d10 pore diameter of not less than 8 Î¼m, a d90 pore diameter of not greater than 35 Î¼m, and a value of df=(d50?’d10)/d50 of less than or equal to 0.50. according to certain embodiments, the total porosity is greater than or equal to 40%. the inventive article is especially suitable for use as a wall-flow diesel particulate filter, wherein the inventive pore microstructure provides low clean and soot-loaded pressure drop in the catalyzed or non-catalyzed state, high filtration efficiency, and high strength.
the inventive ceramic honeycomb articles of the invention are suitable for use in high temperature applications, and are particularly suitable for use as diesel exhaust filtration devices because they exhibit low pressure drops, high filtration efficiency and good strength. to this end, in another aspect, there is provided a ceramic honeycomb article exhibiting the structure of a filter and having an inlet end and an outlet end, a multiplicity of cells extending from the inlet end to the outlet end, the cells having porous walls, wherein part of the total number of cells at the inlet end are plugged along a portion of their lengths, and the remaining part of the cells that are open at the inlet end are preferably plugged at the outlet end along a portion of their lengths, so that an engine exhaust stream passing through the cells of the honeycomb from the inlet end to the outlet end flows into the open cells, then through the cells walls, and out of the article through the open cells at the outlet end.
in another aspect of the present invention, a method for manufacturing a porous ceramic honeycomb article, as described above, is provided. the method comprises the steps of providing a plasticized cordierite precursor batch composition containing inorganic batch components; an optional pore former; a liquid vehicle; and a binder. a honeycomb green body is then formed from the plasticized ceramic precursor batch composition and subsequently fired under conditions effective to convert the green body into a ceramic honeycomb article containing cordierite. in one aspect, the resulting fired ceramic honeycomb article has a total porosity of less than 54%. in a further aspect, the honeycomb article exhibits a narrow pore size distribution characterized by a d10 pore diameter of not less than 8 Î¼m, a d90 pore diameter of not greater than 35 Î¼m, and a value of df=(d50?’d10)/d50 of less than or equal to 0.50.
also provided is a method for manufacturing the inventive article comprising certain combinations of raw materials and heating rates that satisfy the relation p10??8.5, where p10 is defined as p10=3.503[log10(hr1)]+3.106[log10(hr2)]+0.00446[(wt % talc sources)(d50 talc sources)]+0.00497[(wt % silica-forming sources)(d50 silica-forming sources)]+0.00857[(wt % alumina-forming sources)(d50 alumina-forming sources)]??.062(wt % kaolin sources)+0.264(wt % pore formers)??.0147[(wt % kaolin sources)(wt % pore formers)], in which hr1 is the heating rate from 1200-1300Â° c. in Â° c./hr and hr2 is the heating rate from 1300-1360Â° c. in Â° c./hr. the weighted average median particle diameter of the talc is not more than 35 Î¼m and the weighted average median particle diameter of the silica-forming sources is not more than 35 Î¼m.
according to embodiments of the present invention, the combination of a total porosity of at least 40% and a d10 pore diameter of at least 8 Î¼m produces a high permeability and thereby provides a low pressure drop for the clean filter. furthermore, the combination of a total porosity less than 54% and a d90 pore diameter of not more than 35 Î¼m provides high strength to the honeycomb body, and also provides a high filtration efficiency to the particulate filter. additionally, the combination of a total porosity of greater than or equal to 40% and a value of df=(d50?’d10)/d50 of less than or equal to 0.50 provides a low pressure drop for the diesel particulate filter in a soot-loaded state. this unique combination of properties relating to the pore microstructure thus provides a very desirable combination of low clean pressure drop, low soot-loaded pressure drop, high filtration efficiency, and high strength, and has not been previously demonstrated in the prior art. the narrow pore size distribution provided by the present inventive bodies is especially beneficial when the article is used as a catalyzed diesel particulate filter, because a narrow pore size distribution promotes a more uniform distribution of the catalyst on the surfaces of the pore walls. a more uniform thickness of the catalyst coating on the pore walls provides a low clean and soot-loaded pressure drop, and also provides for greater contact between the catalyst and the soot and the catalyst and the exhaust gas, thereby promoting a more efficient use of the catalyst.
furthermore, according to many embodiments of the invention, the method for manufacturing the ceramic article either does not require a pore former, or utilizes commercially available pore formers, such as graphite or polymer beads, which, unlike some natural organic pore formers, are readily available in large quantities and are of a controlled and reproducible particle size.
additional aspects of the invention will be set forth, in part, in the detailed description, figures and any claims which follow, and in part will be derived from the detailed description, or can be learned by practice of the invention. it is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as disclosed.",3,problem,stricter environmental regulations,1.0,exact,1

recently, much interest has been directed towards the diesel engine due to its fuel efficiency, durability and economical aspects. however, diesel emissions have been scrutinized both in the united states and europe, for their possibly harmful effects. as such, stricter environmental regulations will likely require diesel engines to be held to similar standards as gasoline engines. therefore, diesel engine manufacturers and emission-control companies are working to achieve a diesel engine which is faster, cleaner and meets stringent emissions requirements under all operating conditions with minimal cost to the consumer.

2. technical background
recently, much interest has been directed towards the diesel engine due to its fuel efficiency, durability and economical aspects. however, diesel emissions have been scrutinized both in the united states and europe, for their possibly harmful effects. as such, stricter environmental regulations will likely require diesel engines to be held to similar standards as gasoline engines. therefore, diesel engine manufacturers and emission-control companies are working to achieve a diesel engine which is faster, cleaner and meets stringent emissions requirements under all operating conditions with minimal cost to the consumer.
one of the biggest challenges in lowering diesel emissions is controlling the levels of diesel particulate material present in the diesel exhaust stream. diesel particulate material consists mainly of carbon soot. one way of removing the carbon soot from the diesel exhaust is through the use of diesel traps (otherwise referred to as ?œwall-flow filters??or ?œdiesel particulate filters??. diesel particulate filters capture the soot in the diesel exhaust on or in the porous walls of the filter body. the diesel particulate filter is designed to provide for nearly complete filtration of soot without significantly hindering the exhaust flow. however, as the layer of soot collects in the inlet channels of the diesel particulate filter, the lower permeability of the soot layer causes a gradual rise in the back pressure of the filter against the engine, causing the engine to work harder. thus, once the carbon soot in the filter has accumulated to some level, the filter must be regenerated by burning out the soot, thereby restoring the back pressure again to low levels. normally, this regeneration is accomplished under controlled conditions of engine management whereby a slow burn is initiated which lasts for a number of minutes, during which the temperature in the filter rises from a lower operational temperature to a maximum temperature.
cordierite, being a low-cost material, in combination with offering a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion (cte), has been the material of choice in diesel exhaust filtration. to that end, porous cordierite ceramic filters of the wall-flow type have been utilized for the removal of particles in the exhaust stream from some diesel engines since the early 1980s. a diesel particulate filter (dpf) ideally should combine low cte (for thermal shock resistance), low pressure drop (for fuel efficiency), high filtration efficiency (for high removal of particles from the exhaust stream), high strength (to survive handling, canning, and vibration in use), and low cost. however, achieving this combination of features has proven elusive with cordierite dpfs.
thus, dpf design requires the balancing of several properties, including porosity, pore size distribution, thermal expansion, strength, elastic modulus, pressure drop, and manufacturability. further, several engineering tradeoffs have been required in order to fabricate a filter having an acceptable combination of physical properties and processability. for example, increased porosity is often attainable through the use of coarser raw materials, the use of pore forming agents, and or lower sintering temperatures. however, each of these may result in an increase in thermal expansion which may compromise the survivability of the filter in use.
thus, it would be considered a significant advancement in the art to obtain optimized ceramic honeycomb articles, made of cordierite which are suitable for use in filter applications and which exhibit high thermal durability and high filtration efficiency coupled with low pressure drop across the filter. in particular, there is a recognized need in the art for cordierite ceramic honeycomb articles which possess desirable combinations of porosity, relatively narrow pore size distribution, and relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion (cte). to that end, as described below, the present invention provides such cordierite honeycomb articles and methods of manufacturing therefor.

a persistent problem in the art of petroleum refining is to reach acceptably low levels of sulfur content and other contaminants.
a large portion of the world's hydrocarbon reserves contain sulfur, and removal of this sulfur is critical in order to provide acceptable fuels.
government agencies are currently formulating new regulations which will require sulfur content in fuels to be substantially lower than current practice. it is expected that such regulations will require sulfur content of less than 15 wppm.
a number of processes have been attempted for use in removing sulfur, one of which is hydrodesulfurization, wherein a hydrogen flow is exposed to the feedstock in the presence of a suitable catalyst so that sulfur compounds react to produce a volatile product, hydrogen sulfide.
such processes do provide substantial reduction in sulfur in the feed. however, existing facilities do not readily provide for reduction of sulfur content to desired levels. known hydrodesulfurization methods include cocurrent processes, wherein hydrogen and hydrocarbon feed are fed through a reactor or zone in the same direction, and countercurrent processes wherein hydrocarbon is fed in one direction and gas is fed in the other direction.
known cocurrent processes do not provide acceptable levels of sulfur removal for acceptable catalyst volumes, and countercurrent processes typically experience difficulty in reactor flooding which occurs when the desired amount of gas flow to the reactor prevents flow of the hydrocarbon in the counter direction. reduction of gas flow to address flooding reduces the effectiveness of countercurrent hydrodesulfurization processes.
another potential problem with countercurrent processes is that adiabatic countercurrent processes may operate at temperatures much higher than adiabatic cocurrent processes, and this temperature is detrimental to hydrodesulfurization and other catalysts used in the process.

a persistent problem in the art of petroleum refining is to reach acceptably low levels of sulfur content and other contaminants.
a large portion of the world's hydrocarbon reserves contain sulfur, and removal of this sulfur is critical in order to provide acceptable fuels.
government agencies are currently formulating new regulations which will require sulfur content in fuels to be substantially lower than current practice. it is expected that such regulations will require sulfur content of less than 15 wppm.
a number of processes have been attempted for use in removing sulfur, one of which is hydrodesulfurization, wherein a hydrogen flow is exposed to the feedstock in the presence of a suitable catalyst so that sulfur compounds react to produce a volatile product, hydrogen sulfide.
such processes do provide substantial reduction in sulfur in the feed. however, existing facilities do not readily provide for reduction of sulfur content to desired levels. known hydrodesulfurization methods include cocurrent processes, wherein hydrogen and hydrocarbon feed are fed through a reactor or zone in the same direction, and countercurrent processes wherein hydrocarbon is fed in one direction and gas is fed in the other direction.
known cocurrent processes do not provide acceptable levels of sulfur removal for acceptable catalyst volumes, and countercurrent processes typically experience difficulty in reactor flooding which occurs when the desired amount of gas flow to the reactor prevents flow of the hydrocarbon in the counter direction. reduction of gas flow to address flooding reduces the effectiveness of countercurrent hydrodesulfurization processes.
another potential problem with countercurrent processes is that adiabatic countercurrent processes may operate at temperatures much higher than adiabatic cocurrent processes, and this temperature is detrimental to hydrodesulfurization and other catalysts used in the process.
based upon the foregoing, it is clear that the need remains for an advantageous process for removal of sulfur to levels which will meet the expected regulations on hydrocarbons for use as fuel.

nox emissions from vehicles with internal combustion engines are an environmental problem recognized worldwide. several countries, including the united states, have long had regulations pending that will limit nox emissions from vehicles. manufacturers and researchers have put considerable effort toward meeting those regulations. nox emissions can be controlled in conventional gasoline powered vehicles, which use stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures, by three-way catalysts. in the absence of oxygen, three-way catalysts reduce nox by reaction with co and unburned hydrocarbons. in diesel powered vehicles and lien burn gasoline engines, however, the exhaust is too oxygen-rich for three-way catalysts to be effective.
several solutions have been proposed for controlling nox emissions in diesel-powered vehicles. one set of approaches focuses on the engine. nox is generated primarily at high temperatures. by limiting the adiabatic flame temperature, through exhaust gas recirculation (egr) for example, nox production can be reduced. lowering the adiabatic flame temperature to eliminate nox production, however, causes engine efficiency to decrease and smoke to appear in the exhaust. it is commonly believed that there is a trade-off between nox production and particulate matter production in diesel engines. it is less well known that if the adiabatic flame temperature is dropped sufficiently, particulate matter production will also decrease. in any event, clean combustion cannot be achieved solely by varying the adiabatic flame temperature at which a diesel engine operates.
one way to reduce total combustion byproducts is to homogenize fuel air mixtures in diesel engines. this can be accomplished by mixing fuel with air prior to injection or injecting all or part of the fuel into an engine cylinder before or early in a compression stroke. while studies show a reduction in emissions, this approach has not been proven commercially and does not eliminate diesel combustion byproducts altogether.
another set of approaches remove nox from the vehicle exhaust. these include the use of lean-burn nox catalysts, nox adsorber-catalysts, and selective catalytic reduction (scr). lean-burn nox catalysts promote the reduction of nox under oxygen-rich conditions. reduction of nox in an oxidizing atmosphere is difficult. it has proved challenging to find a lean-burn nox catalyst that has the required activity, durability, and operating temperature range. lean-burn nox catalysts also tend to be hydrothermally unstable. a noticeable loss of activity occurs after relatively little use. lean burn nox catalysts typically employ a zeolite wash coat, which is thought to provide a reducing microenvironment. the introduction of a reductant, such as diesel fuel, into the exhaust is generally required and introduces a fuel economy penalty of 3% or more. currently, peak nox conversion efficiency with lean-burn catalysts is unacceptably low.
nox adsorber-catalysts alternately adsorb nox and catalytically reduce it. the adsorber can be taken offline during regeneration and a reducing atmosphere provided. the adsorbant is generally an alkaline earth oxide adsorbant; such as baco3 and the catalyst can be a precious metal, such as ru.
scr involves using ammonia as the reductant. the nox can be temporarily stored in an adsorbant or ammonia can be fed continuously into the exhaust. scr can achieve nox reductions in excess of 90%, however, there is concern over the lack of infrastructure for distributing ammonia or a suitable precursor. scr also raises concerns relating to the possible release of ammonia into the environment.
an alternative approach to reducing emissions is to convert the chemical energy of the fuel into electrical energy using a fuel cell. fuel cells are not very effective at extracting power from long chain hydrocarbons, but fuel reformers can be used to break long chain hydrocarbons into smaller more reactive molecules such as short chain hydrocarbons, oxygenated hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide, which are suitable fuels for a fuel cell. for example, u.s. pat. no. 5,678,647 suggests powering a fuel cell for a vehicle drive system using a conventional fuel processed through a reformer. the reformer and the fuel cell must be heated before they are operative to produce useful power.
u.s. pat. no. 6,276,473 describes a hybrid power generation system comprising an engine, a fuel reformer, and a fuel cell. the engine is used to provide cold start-power and the engine's exhaust is used to heat the fuel reformer and the fuel cell. when the reformer and fuel cell reach their operating temperatures, the reformer/fuel cell system begins to produce power. the engine can continue to operate after warm-up or be turned off.
u.s. pat. no. 6,655,325 describes a power generation system comprising an internal combustion engine and a fuel cell. the engine can operate as a reformer and provides fuel for the fuel cell. the engine can also provide shaft power, or alternatively all the shaft power can be derived from the fuel cell. particulate matter in the engine exhaust is said to be removed by the fuel cell and a catalytic converter. it is also suggested that by treating the fuel cell exhaust with a catalytic converter, near zero emissions of hydrocarbons and nitric oxide can be achieved.
in spite of progress, there remains a long felt need for environmentally friendly, efficient, and reliable power generation systems for vehicles.

u.s. pat. no. 6,655,325 describes a power generation system comprising an internal combustion engine and a fuel cell. the engine can operate as a reformer and provides fuel for the fuel cell. the engine can also provide shaft power, or alternatively all the shaft power can be derived from the fuel cell. particulate matter in the engine exhaust is said to be removed by the fuel cell and a catalytic converter. it is also suggested that by treating the fuel cell exhaust with a catalytic converter, near zero emissions of hydrocarbons and nitric oxide can be achieved.
in spite of progress, there remains a long felt need for environmentally friendly, efficient, and reliable power generation systems for vehicles.
the following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. this summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. the primary purpose of this summary is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.
the present invention relates to vehicle power generation systems that use fuel cells. one aspect of the invention relates to a power generation system in which an internal combustion engine is operated to produce shaft power and an exhaust stream. a fuel cell is used to treat the exhaust stream. fluctuations in power demand are met, at least in part, by increasing or decreasing power output from the fuel cell and/or power uptake or output from one or more power storage devices. this stabilizes the engine operation and the properties of the exhaust stream. stabilizing the exhaust stream facilitates treating the exhaust for pollution control. stabilizing the exhaust stream also facilitate operating a fuel cell using the exhaust as fuel. a power generation system according to this aspect for the invention can be configured to meet virtually any emission control regulation.
while the fuel cell can produce useful power from the engine exhaust, the fuel cell can also be provided with another fuel source. another fuel source could be a fuel reformer or engine fuel injected directly into the exhaust. according to a further aspect of the invention, the exhaust of an engine is treated with a fuel cell having an electrolyte that conducts protons. in addition to removing pollutants from the exhaust while generating useful power, the fuel cell can provide a supply of low acidity water. the water can be used in reformering fuel for the fuel cell. the fuel can be reformed in the fuel cell itself, or in a separate reformer.
to the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects and implementations of the invention. these are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed. other aspects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.",5,problem,engine efficiency decrease,1.0,partial,-1

nox emissions from vehicles with internal combustion engines are an environmental problem recognized worldwide. several countries, including the united states, have long had regulations pending that will limit nox emissions from vehicles. manufacturers and researchers have put considerable effort toward meeting those regulations. nox emissions can be controlled in conventional gasoline powered vehicles, which use stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures, by three-way catalysts. in the absence of oxygen, three-way catalysts reduce nox by reaction with co and unburned hydrocarbons. in diesel powered vehicles and lien burn gasoline engines, however, the exhaust is too oxygen-rich for three-way catalysts to be effective.
several solutions have been proposed for controlling nox emissions in diesel-powered vehicles. one set of approaches focuses on the engine. nox is generated primarily at high temperatures. by limiting the adiabatic flame temperature, through exhaust gas recirculation (egr) for example, nox production can be reduced. lowering the adiabatic flame temperature to eliminate nox production, however, causes engine efficiency to decrease and smoke to appear in the exhaust. it is commonly believed that there is a trade-off between nox production and particulate matter production in diesel engines. it is less well known that if the adiabatic flame temperature is dropped sufficiently, particulate matter production will also decrease. in any event, clean combustion cannot be achieved solely by varying the adiabatic flame temperature at which a diesel engine operates.
one way to reduce total combustion byproducts is to homogenize fuel air mixtures in diesel engines. this can be accomplished by mixing fuel with air prior to injection or injecting all or part of the fuel into an engine cylinder before or early in a compression stroke. while studies show a reduction in emissions, this approach has not been proven commercially and does not eliminate diesel combustion byproducts altogether.
another set of approaches remove nox from the vehicle exhaust. these include the use of lean-burn nox catalysts, nox adsorber-catalysts, and selective catalytic reduction (scr). lean-burn nox catalysts promote the reduction of nox under oxygen-rich conditions. reduction of nox in an oxidizing atmosphere is difficult. it has proved challenging to find a lean-burn nox catalyst that has the required activity, durability, and operating temperature range. lean-burn nox catalysts also tend to be hydrothermally unstable. a noticeable loss of activity occurs after relatively little use. lean burn nox catalysts typically employ a zeolite wash coat, which is thought to provide a reducing microenvironment. the introduction of a reductant, such as diesel fuel, into the exhaust is generally required and introduces a fuel economy penalty of 3% or more. currently, peak nox conversion efficiency with lean-burn catalysts is unacceptably low.
nox adsorber-catalysts alternately adsorb nox and catalytically reduce it. the adsorber can be taken offline during regeneration and a reducing atmosphere provided. the adsorbant is generally an alkaline earth oxide adsorbant; such as baco3 and the catalyst can be a precious metal, such as ru.
scr involves using ammonia as the reductant. the nox can be temporarily stored in an adsorbant or ammonia can be fed continuously into the exhaust. scr can achieve nox reductions in excess of 90%, however, there is concern over the lack of infrastructure for distributing ammonia or a suitable precursor. scr also raises concerns relating to the possible release of ammonia into the environment.

several solutions have been proposed for controlling nox emissions in diesel-powered vehicles. one set of approaches focuses on the engine. nox is generated primarily at high temperatures. by limiting the adiabatic flame temperature, through exhaust gas recirculation (egr) for example, nox production can be reduced. lowering the adiabatic flame temperature to eliminate nox production, however, causes engine efficiency to decrease and smoke to appear in the exhaust. it is commonly believed that there is a trade-off between nox production and particulate matter production in diesel engines. it is less well known that if the adiabatic flame temperature is dropped sufficiently, particulate matter production will also decrease. in any event, clean combustion cannot be achieved solely by varying the adiabatic flame temperature at which a diesel engine operates.
one way to reduce total combustion byproducts is to homogenize fuel air mixtures in diesel engines. this can be accomplished by mixing fuel with air prior to injection or injecting all or part of the fuel into an engine cylinder before or early in a compression stroke. while studies show a reduction in emissions, this approach has not been proven commercially and does not eliminate diesel combustion byproducts altogether.
another set of approaches remove nox from the vehicle exhaust. these include the use of lean-burn nox catalysts, nox adsorber-catalysts, and selective catalytic reduction (scr). lean-burn nox catalysts promote the reduction of nox under oxygen-rich conditions. reduction of nox in an oxidizing atmosphere is difficult. it has proved challenging to find a lean-burn nox catalyst that has the required activity, durability, and operating temperature range. lean-burn nox catalysts also tend to be hydrothermally unstable. a noticeable loss of activity occurs after relatively little use. lean burn nox catalysts typically employ a zeolite wash coat, which is thought to provide a reducing microenvironment. the introduction of a reductant, such as diesel fuel, into the exhaust is generally required and introduces a fuel economy penalty of 3% or more. currently, peak nox conversion efficiency with lean-burn catalysts is unacceptably low.
nox adsorber-catalysts alternately adsorb nox and catalytically reduce it. the adsorber can be taken offline during regeneration and a reducing atmosphere provided. the adsorbant is generally an alkaline earth oxide adsorbant; such as baco3 and the catalyst can be a precious metal, such as ru.
scr involves using ammonia as the reductant. the nox can be temporarily stored in an adsorbant or ammonia can be fed continuously into the exhaust. scr can achieve nox reductions in excess of 90%, however, there is concern over the lack of infrastructure for distributing ammonia or a suitable precursor. scr also raises concerns relating to the possible release of ammonia into the environment.
an alternative approach to reducing emissions is to convert the chemical energy of the fuel into electrical energy using a fuel cell. fuel cells are not very effective at extracting power from long chain hydrocarbons, but fuel reformers can be used to break long chain hydrocarbons into smaller more reactive molecules such as short chain hydrocarbons, oxygenated hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide, which are suitable fuels for a fuel cell. for example, u.s. pat. no. 5,678,647 suggests powering a fuel cell for a vehicle drive system using a conventional fuel processed through a reformer. the reformer and the fuel cell must be heated before they are operative to produce useful power.
u.s. pat. no. 6,276,473 describes a hybrid power generation system comprising an engine, a fuel reformer, and a fuel cell. the engine is used to provide cold start-power and the engine's exhaust is used to heat the fuel reformer and the fuel cell. when the reformer and fuel cell reach their operating temperatures, the reformer/fuel cell system begins to produce power. the engine can continue to operate after warm-up or be turned off.
u.s. pat. no. 6,655,325 describes a power generation system comprising an internal combustion engine and a fuel cell. the engine can operate as a reformer and provides fuel for the fuel cell. the engine can also provide shaft power, or alternatively all the shaft power can be derived from the fuel cell. particulate matter in the engine exhaust is said to be removed by the fuel cell and a catalytic converter. it is also suggested that by treating the fuel cell exhaust with a catalytic converter, near zero emissions of hydrocarbons and nitric oxide can be achieved.
in spite of progress, there remains a long felt need for environmentally friendly, efficient, and reliable power generation systems for vehicles.

the following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. this summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. the primary purpose of this summary is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.
one aspect of the invention relates an exhaust treatment system having an scr reactor downstream of a nox adsorber in which syn gas from a fuel reformer is used to regenerate the nox adsorber. preferably, the nox adsorber has a catalyst and functions to reduce nox during regeneration. syn gas from a fuel reformer improves the efficiency of the regeneration cycle as compared to injecting fuel directly into the exhaust system. the scr reactor further enhances conversion by capturing ammonia produced during regeneration and using the ammonia to reduce nox during lean operation.
another aspect of the invention relates to an exhaust treatment system having an scr reactor downstream of an lnt and an ammonia source separate from the lnt. an lnt will produce some ammonia, but a separate ammonia source can simplify achieving high nox conversions. the ammonia demand is considerably less than in a pure scr system and the control system can be simplified by targeting conversion of less than all the nox escaping the lnt. in one embodiment, the ammonia source comprises an ammonia plant that produces ammonia from a reaction between nox extracted from a partial exhaust stream and syn gas obtained from a fuel reformer.
a further aspect of the invention relates to an exhaust system comprising first and second lnts and one or more valves for selectively directing the exhaust into one or the other lnt. the system further comprises one or more scrs downstream of the lnts. this system can be used to reduce the fuel penalty associated with regeneration and allows the lnts to be regenerated with higher reductant concentrations and longer residence times. in a preferred embodiment, the exhaust streams of the lnts are unified and lead to an oxidation catalyst. this arrangement allows excess reductants to be oxidized without having to inject air or another oxygen source into the exhaust.
a still further aspect of the invention relates to a device that can be used to implement the foregoing. the device comprises first and second nox adsorbers contained in a single housing and one or more valves for selectively directing the exhaust into one or the other adsorber. the one or more valves can be a simple damper. this aspect of the invention provides a simple, compact, and economic method of implementing dual adsorber-based exhaust treatment systems. another aspect of the invention relates to coating a moving part in an exhaust system with an oxidation catalyst to mitigate fouling.
additional aspects of the invention relate to control of lnt/scr exhaust treatment systems. according to one of these aspects, an ammonia concentration between a lnt and an scr reactor is measured and used to determine when to terminate a regeneration cycle. another of these aspects relates to maintaining an estimate of an amount of ammonia adsorbed in the scr reactor and selectively initiating regeneration of the lnt based on the estimate, whereby regeneration can begin before the ammonia in the lnt is exhausted. this can reduce or prevent nox breakthrough during the regeneration cycle. a related aspects of the invention involves selectively initiating regeneration based on an nox concentration measured between an lnt and an scr reactor. a further aspect of the invention relates to beginning regeneration based on an estimate of the amount of nox adsorbed in the lnt. in one embodiment, the regeneration cycle is initiated at a point where the lnt is substantially below its nox storage capacity, whereby the fraction of nox converted to ammonia during regeneration is substantially greater than it would be if regeneration were postponed until the lnt was closer to saturation. a still further aspect of the invention relates to providing feedback control over the rate at which reductant is supplied during regeneration. the reductant supply rate can be maximized to reduce regeneration time, reduce the fuel penalty, and increase ammonia production subject to limits on the amount of reductant allowed to escape the lnt.

one aspect of the invention relates an exhaust treatment system having an scr reactor downstream of a nox adsorber in which syn gas from a fuel reformer is used to regenerate the nox adsorber. preferably, the nox adsorber has a catalyst and functions to reduce nox during regeneration. syn gas from a fuel reformer improves the efficiency of the regeneration cycle as compared to injecting fuel directly into the exhaust system. the scr reactor further enhances conversion by capturing ammonia produced during regeneration and using the ammonia to reduce nox during lean operation.
another aspect of the invention relates to an exhaust treatment system having an scr reactor downstream of an lnt and an ammonia source separate from the lnt. an lnt will produce some ammonia, but a separate ammonia source can simplify achieving high nox conversions. the ammonia demand is considerably less than in a pure scr system and the control system can be simplified by targeting conversion of less than all the nox escaping the lnt. in one embodiment, the ammonia source comprises an ammonia plant that produces ammonia from a reaction between nox extracted from a partial exhaust stream and syn gas obtained from a fuel reformer.
a further aspect of the invention relates to an exhaust system comprising first and second lnts and one or more valves for selectively directing the exhaust into one or the other lnt. the system further comprises one or more scrs downstream of the lnts. this system can be used to reduce the fuel penalty associated with regeneration and allows the lnts to be regenerated with higher reductant concentrations and longer residence times. in a preferred embodiment, the exhaust streams of the lnts are unified and lead to an oxidation catalyst. this arrangement allows excess reductants to be oxidized without having to inject air or another oxygen source into the exhaust.
a still further aspect of the invention relates to a device that can be used to implement the foregoing. the device comprises first and second nox adsorbers contained in a single housing and one or more valves for selectively directing the exhaust into one or the other adsorber. the one or more valves can be a simple damper. this aspect of the invention provides a simple, compact, and economic method of implementing dual adsorber-based exhaust treatment systems. another aspect of the invention relates to coating a moving part in an exhaust system with an oxidation catalyst to mitigate fouling.
additional aspects of the invention relate to control of lnt/scr exhaust treatment systems. according to one of these aspects, an ammonia concentration between a lnt and an scr reactor is measured and used to determine when to terminate a regeneration cycle. another of these aspects relates to maintaining an estimate of an amount of ammonia adsorbed in the scr reactor and selectively initiating regeneration of the lnt based on the estimate, whereby regeneration can begin before the ammonia in the lnt is exhausted. this can reduce or prevent nox breakthrough during the regeneration cycle. a related aspects of the invention involves selectively initiating regeneration based on an nox concentration measured between an lnt and an scr reactor. a further aspect of the invention relates to beginning regeneration based on an estimate of the amount of nox adsorbed in the lnt. in one embodiment, the regeneration cycle is initiated at a point where the lnt is substantially below its nox storage capacity, whereby the fraction of nox converted to ammonia during regeneration is substantially greater than it would be if regeneration were postponed until the lnt was closer to saturation. a still further aspect of the invention relates to providing feedback control over the rate at which reductant is supplied during regeneration. the reductant supply rate can be maximized to reduce regeneration time, reduce the fuel penalty, and increase ammonia production subject to limits on the amount of reductant allowed to escape the lnt.
to the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects and implementations of the invention. these are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed. other aspects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.",2,problem,environmental problem,1.0,exact,1

nox emissions from vehicles with internal combustion engines are an environmental problem recognized worldwide. several countries, including the united states, have long had regulations pending that will limit nox emissions from vehicles. manufacturers and researchers have put considerable effort toward meeting those regulations. in conventional gasoline powered vehicles that use stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures, three-way catalysts have been shown to control nox emissions. in diesel powered vehicles and vehicles with lean-burn gasoline engines, however, the exhaust is too oxygen-rich for three-way catalysts to be effective.
several solutions have been proposed for controlling nox emissions from diesel powered vehicles and lean-burn gasoline engines. one set of approaches focuses on the engine. techniques such as exhaust gas recirculation and homogenizing fuel-air mixtures can reduce nox emissions. these techniques alone, however, will not eliminate nox emissions. another set of approaches remove nox from the vehicle exhaust. these include the use of lean-burn nox catalysts, lean nox traps (lnts), and selective catalytic reduction (scr).
lean-burn nox catalysts promote the reduction of nox under oxygen-rich conditions. reduction of nox in an oxidizing atmosphere is difficult. it has proved challenging to find a lean-burn nox catalyst that has the required activity, durability, and operating temperature range. lean-burn nox catalysts also tend to be hydrothermally unstable. a noticeable loss of activity occurs after relatively little use. lean burn nox catalysts typically employ a zeolite wash coat, which is thought to provide a reducing microenvironment. the introduction of a reductant, such as diesel fuel, into the exhaust is generally required and introduces a fuel economy penalty of 3% or more. currently, peak nox conversion efficiency with lean-burn catalysts is unacceptably low.
lnts are nox adsorbers combined with catalysts for nox reduction. the adsorber removes nox from lean exhaust. periodically, the adsorber is regenerated by introducing a reducing environment. in the reducing environment, nox desorbs and is reduced over the catalyst. the adsorbant is generally an alkaline earth oxide adsorbant, such as baco3 and the catalyst can be a precious metal, such as ru.
scr involves the reduction of nox by ammonia. the reaction takes place even in an oxidizing environment. the nox can be temporarily stored in an adsorbant or ammonia can be fed continuously into the exhaust. scr can achieve nox reductions in excess of 90%, however, there is concern over the lack of infrastructure for distributing ammonia or a suitable precursor. scr also raises concerns relating to the possible release of ammonia into the environment.
u.s. pat. no. 6,560,958 describes an lnt system in which hydrogen-rich synthesis gas (syn gas), including h2 and co, is used as a reductant to regenerate the adsorber. the syn gas is produced from diesel fuel in a plasma converter. periodically, the adsorber is taken offline from the exhaust system and supplied with the syn gas. a dual adsorber system is also described.
u.s. pat. no. 6,732,507 describes a hybrid exhaust treatment system using an lnt and an scr reactor in series. the scr reactor captures ammonia produced by the lnt during regeneration and uses the captured ammonia to increase the extent of nox conversion.

nox emissions from vehicles with internal combustion engines are an environmental problem recognized worldwide. several countries, including the united states, have long had regulations pending that will limit nox emissions from vehicles. manufacturers and researchers have put considerable effort toward meeting those regulations. in conventional gasoline powered vehicles that use stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures, three-way catalysts have been shown to control nox emissions. in diesel powered vehicles and vehicles with lean-burn gasoline engines, however, the exhaust is too oxygen-rich for three-way catalysts to be effective.
several solutions have been proposed for controlling nox emissions from diesel powered vehicles and lean-burn gasoline engines. one set of approaches focuses on the engine. techniques such as exhaust gas recirculation and homogenizing fuel-air mixtures can reduce nox emissions. these techniques alone, however, will not eliminate nox emissions. another set of approaches remove nox from the vehicle exhaust. these include the use of lean-burn nox catalysts, lean nox traps (lnts), and selective catalytic reduction (scr).
lean-burn nox catalysts promote the reduction of nox under oxygen-rich conditions. reduction of nox in an oxidizing atmosphere is difficult. it has proved challenging to find a lean-burn nox catalyst that has the required activity, durability, and operating temperature range. lean-burn nox catalysts also tend to be hydrothermally unstable. a noticeable loss of activity occurs after relatively little use. lean burn nox catalysts typically employ a zeolite wash coat, which is thought to provide a reducing microenvironment. the introduction of a reductant, such as diesel fuel, into the exhaust is generally required and introduces a fuel economy penalty of 3% or more. currently, peak nox conversion efficiency with lean-burn catalysts is unacceptably low.
lnts are nox adsorbers combined with catalysts for nox reduction. the adsorber removes nox from lean exhaust. periodically, the adsorber is regenerated by introducing a reducing environment. in the reducing environment, nox desorbs and is reduced over the catalyst. the adsorbant is generally an alkaline earth oxide adsorbant, such as baco3 and the catalyst can be a precious metal, such as ru.
scr involves the reduction of nox by ammonia. the reaction takes place even in an oxidizing environment. the nox can be temporarily stored in an adsorbant or ammonia can be fed continuously into the exhaust. scr can achieve nox reductions in excess of 90%, however, there is concern over the lack of infrastructure for distributing ammonia or a suitable precursor. scr also raises concerns relating to the possible release of ammonia into the environment.
u.s. pat. no. 6,560,958 describes an lnt system in which hydrogen-rich synthesis gas (syn gas), including h2 and co, is used as a reductant to regenerate the adsorber. the syn gas is produced from diesel fuel in a plasma converter. periodically, the adsorber is taken offline from the exhaust system and supplied with the syn gas. a dual adsorber system is also described.
u.s. pat. no. 6,732,507 describes a hybrid exhaust treatment system using an lnt and an scr reactor in series. the scr reactor captures ammonia produced by the lnt during regeneration and uses the captured ammonia to increase the extent of nox conversion.
there continues to be a long felt need for reliable, affordable, and effective systems for removing nox from the exhaust of diesel and lean-burn gasoline engines.

one aspect of the invention relates an exhaust treatment system having an scr reactor downstream of a nox adsorber in which syn gas from a fuel reformer is used to regenerate the nox adsorber. preferably, the nox adsorber has a catalyst and functions to reduce nox during regeneration. syn gas from a fuel reformer improves the efficiency of the regeneration cycle as compared to injecting fuel directly into the exhaust system. the scr reactor further enhances conversion by capturing ammonia produced during regeneration and using the ammonia to reduce nox during lean operation.
another aspect of the invention relates to an exhaust treatment system having an scr reactor downstream of an lnt and an ammonia source separate from the lnt. an lnt will produce some ammonia, but a separate ammonia source can simplify achieving high nox conversions. the ammonia demand is considerably less than in a pure scr system and the control system can be simplified by targeting conversion of less than all the nox escaping the lnt. in one embodiment, the ammonia source comprises an ammonia plant that produces ammonia from a reaction between nox extracted from a partial exhaust stream and syn gas obtained from a fuel reformer.

nox emissions from vehicles with internal combustion engines are an environmental problem recognized worldwide. several countries, including the united states, have long had regulations pending that will limit nox emissions from vehicles. manufacturers and researchers have put considerable effort toward meeting those regulations. in conventional gasoline powered vehicles that use stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures, three-way catalysts have been shown to control nox emissions. in diesel powered vehicles and vehicles with lean-burn gasoline engines, however, the exhaust is too oxygen-rich for three-way catalysts to be effective.
several solutions have been proposed for controlling nox emissions from diesel powered vehicles and lean-burn gasoline engines. one set of approaches focuses on the engine. techniques such as exhaust gas recirculation and homogenizing fuel-air mixtures can reduce nox emissions. these techniques alone, however, will not eliminate nox emissions. another set of approaches remove nox from the vehicle exhaust. these include the use of lean-burn nox catalysts, lean nox traps (lnts), and selective catalytic reduction (scr).
lean-burn nox catalysts promote the reduction of nox under oxygen-rich conditions. reduction of nox in an oxidizing atmosphere is difficult. it has proved challenging to find a lean-burn nox catalyst that has the required activity, durability, and operating temperature range. lean-burn nox catalysts also tend to be hydrothermally unstable. a noticeable loss of activity occurs after relatively little use. lean burn nox catalysts typically employ a zeolite wash coat, which is thought to provide a reducing microenvironment. the introduction of a reductant, such as diesel fuel, into the exhaust is generally required and introduces a fuel economy penalty of 3% or more. currently, peak nox conversion efficiency with lean-burn catalysts is unacceptably low.
lnts are nox adsorbers combined with catalysts for nox reduction. the adsorber removes nox from lean exhaust. periodically, the adsorber is regenerated by introducing a reducing environment. in the reducing environment, nox desorbs and is reduced over the catalyst. the adsorbant is generally an alkaline earth oxide adsorbant, such as baco3 and the catalyst can be a precious metal, such as ru.
scr involves the reduction of nox by ammonia. the reaction takes place even in an oxidizing environment. the nox can be temporarily stored in an adsorbant or ammonia can be fed continuously into the exhaust. scr can achieve nox reductions in excess of 90%, however, there is concern over the lack of infrastructure for distributing ammonia or a suitable precursor. scr also raises concerns relating to the possible release of ammonia into the environment.

the following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. this summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. the primary purpose of this summary is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.
one aspect of the invention relates an exhaust treatment system having an scr reactor downstream of a nox adsorber in which syn gas from a fuel reformer is used to regenerate the nox adsorber. preferably, the nox adsorber has a catalyst and functions to reduce nox during regeneration. syn gas from a fuel reformer improves the efficiency of the regeneration cycle as compared to injecting fuel directly into the exhaust system. the scr reactor further enhances conversion by capturing ammonia produced during regeneration and using the ammonia to reduce nox during lean operation.
another aspect of the invention relates to an exhaust treatment system having an scr reactor downstream of an lnt and an ammonia source separate from the lnt. an lnt will produce some ammonia, but a separate ammonia source can simplify achieving high nox conversions. the ammonia demand is considerably less than in a pure scr system and the control system can be simplified by targeting conversion of less than all the nox escaping the lnt. in one embodiment, the ammonia source comprises an ammonia plant that produces ammonia from a reaction between nox extracted from a partial exhaust stream and syn gas obtained from a fuel reformer.
a further aspect of the invention relates to an exhaust system comprising first and second lnts and one or more valves for selectively directing the exhaust into one or the other lnt. the system further comprises one or more scrs downstream of the lnts. this system can be used to reduce the fuel penalty associated with regeneration and allows the lnts to be regenerated with higher reductant concentrations and longer residence times. in a preferred embodiment, the exhaust streams of the lnts are unified and lead to an oxidation catalyst. this arrangement allows excess reductants to be oxidized without having to inject air or another oxygen source into the exhaust.
a still further aspect of the invention relates to a device that can be used to implement the foregoing. the device comprises first and second nox adsorbers contained in a single housing and one or more valves for selectively directing the exhaust into one or the other adsorber. the one or more valves can be a simple damper. this aspect of the invention provides a simple, compact, and economic method of implementing dual adsorber-based exhaust treatment systems. another aspect of the invention relates to coating a moving part in an exhaust system with an oxidation catalyst to mitigate fouling.

the statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.
manufacturers of internal combustion engines are continually developing new engine control strategies to satisfy customer demands and meet various regulations. one such engine control strategy comprises operating an engine at an air/fuel ratio that is lean of stoichiometry to improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. such engines include both compression-ignition (diesel) and lean-burn spark-ignition engines. when an engine operates in a region lean of stoichiometry, combustion temperatures typically increase, leading to increased nox emissions. one proposed type exhaust aftertreatment system and control strategy for managing and reducing nox emissions includes injection of a reductant into an exhaust gas feedstream upstream of a hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction (?˜hc-scr?? catalytic device to cause a reduction of nox exhaust gases to nitrogen and oxygen across the hc-scr device, among other gases.
currently, proposed systems for injecting reductants for selective catalyst reduction of nox require additional hardware and control schemes to accomplish such operation. an example of such a system includes injection of engine fuel into the exhaust stream. the effectiveness of this method decreases significantly at an exhaust temperature below 400Â° c. at the point of injection, and requires an adequate residence time of the reductant in the exhaust feedstream. another example includes injection of ammonia into the exhaust feedstream upstream of a reduction catalyst. there are infrastructure-related problems associated with storage, transport, and handling of ammonia for a large fleet. furthermore, un-reacted ammonia may pass through the scr and be exhausted into the atmosphere. another example comprises use of urea as a reductant for selective catalytic reduction. such a system requires replenishing urea on-board the vehicle, which requires an infrastructure to distribute the urea. furthermore, the freezing point of the urea solution is ??2Â° c., presenting a problem for its use in cold climates. another example comprises use of nox storage catalysts. these catalysts can be effective, but they typically require a large catalyst volume and a substantial mass of expensive platinum-group metals (e.g., pt, pd, and rh) in combination with extremely low sulfur fuel and periodic intrusive operation of the engine to regenerate the catalyst, thus reducing the effective fuel economy of the vehicle.
hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction (hc-scr) is a technology for reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides in lean exhaust, such as diesel exhaust. one of the significant challenges of implementing hc-scr is to develop a system that allows sufficient reduction of nox emissions over the range of exhaust temperatures found in diesel engines at the speeds and loads experienced during typical, every-day operation. furthermore, it is desirable that the hydrocarbon reductant be present on the vehicle. one source of reductant is the exhaust itself, but typical hydrocarbons present in engine exhaust are generally less active than diesel fuel. the use of diesel fuel and selected diesel fuel-component hydrocarbons as the reductant has been explored by several investigators. results indicate that the nox reduction efficiency of hc-scr catalysts can be greatly improved if appropriate active hydrocarbon species are used. the most effective active species appear to be oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. these oxygenated species are produced by low-temperature oxidation of long, straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons of the type that are present in diesel fuel. also, long, straight-chain alkenes are produced by low-temperature oxidation of these same alkanes, and have been found to be more effective reductants than the long, straight-chain alkanes in some studies.
a system that results in adequate reduction of nox emissions over a range of exhaust temperatures typically found in diesel engines at the speeds and loads experienced in every-day driving, i.e., 200Â° c.-500Â° c., is desirable. a number of hydrocarbons have been shown to be effective for the reduction of nox over silver-alumina (ag/al2o3) and barium-yttria (bay) zeolite catalysts, including long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons, alkene hydrocarbons, and diesel fuel, as well as alcohols and aldehydes.
hydrocarbons present in diesel and gasoline engine exhaust such as methane, ethane, propene, and propane require high temperatures for adequate nox conversion, and are generally not suitable for hc-scr. long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons such as n-octane and n-decane that are present in diesel fuel require somewhat lower temperatures for adequate nox conversion compared to the lighter hydrocarbons. this observation has led to the use of diesel fuel and long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons as the nox reductant in a number of studies. these studies have shown, however, that diesel fuel as well as long, straight-chain hydrocarbons are only adequate above a catalyst temperature of about 300Â° c. (573 k) and low catalyst space velocity. further work has shown that alcohols and aldehydes can reduce nox at catalyst temperatures as low as 200 to 250Â° c. (473 k to 523 k). long, straight-chain alkene hydrocarbons have been found to be effective at temperatures as low as 250 to 300Â° c. (523 k to 573 k). however, these species are not readily available in engine exhaust streams. a method for producing these species on-board the vehicle that leads to efficient selective reduction of nox over the entire desired exhaust temperature range is desireable.
it has been reported that the peak temperature for nox conversion using diesel fuel can be reduced by injecting the diesel fuel into a region upstream of the catalyst that has been preheated to 400Â° c. (673 k) while maintaining a lower catalyst temperature. peak nox conversion efficiencies have been obtained at catalyst temperatures near 300Â° c. (573 k) with this method. it was believed that the diesel fuel was partially oxidized at 400Â° c. (673 k) to form species that were more effective for hc-scr than diesel fuel by itself. the drawback to this method, however, is that supplemental heating of the exhaust may not be suitable for practical engine exhaust systems on a vehicle. ignition improvers, when added to diesel fuel, have been shown to lower the autoignition temperature by lowering the temperature where diesel fuel oxidation begins to take place. a method to take advantage of this lower oxidation temperature to prepare partial oxidation products for use in exhaust hc-scr can be useful.
specific lean-operating engine configurations may employ oxidation catalytic devices immediately downstream of the engine to manage exhaust emissions related to hydrocarbons and particulate matter, and accommodate fuel sulfur. an oxidation catalyst readily oxidizes aldehydes. any aldehydes produced in engine in-cylinder burning are oxidized in the oxidation catalyst and are unavailable for nox reduction in an hc-scr device.
thus, there is a need for a method and system to facilitate hydrocarbon-selective reduction of exhaust gas nox in an aftertreatment system for an engine operating lean of stoichiometry wherein the aftertreatment system includes an oxidation or other catalytic device upstream of the hc-scr device, while addressing issues related thereto.
in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a method and apparatus for nox reduction are provided, which address the aforementioned need, comprising an exhaust gas purifying system. the system includes a hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction device, adapted to treat exhaust gas flowing from an internal combustion engine. there is an injector device adapted to inject a blend of fuel and an ignition improver into the exhaust gas at a location upstream of the hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction catalyst. a control module is adapted to control the injector device to inject a quantity of the blended fuel and ignition improver into the exhaust gas when temperature of the exhaust gas at the location of the injection is greater than about 280Â° c.

manufacturers of internal combustion engines are continually developing new engine control strategies to satisfy customer demands and meet various regulations. one such engine control strategy comprises operating an engine at an air/fuel ratio that is lean of stoichiometry to improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. such engines include both compression-ignition (diesel) and lean-burn spark-ignition engines. when an engine operates in a region lean of stoichiometry, combustion temperatures typically increase, leading to increased nox emissions. one proposed type exhaust aftertreatment system and control strategy for managing and reducing nox emissions includes injection of a reductant into an exhaust gas feedstream upstream of a hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction (?˜hc-scr?? catalytic device to cause a reduction of nox exhaust gases to nitrogen and oxygen across the hc-scr device, among other gases.
currently, proposed systems for injecting reductants for selective catalyst reduction of nox require additional hardware and control schemes to accomplish such operation. an example of such a system includes injection of engine fuel into the exhaust stream. the effectiveness of this method decreases significantly at an exhaust temperature below 400Â° c. at the point of injection, and requires an adequate residence time of the reductant in the exhaust feedstream. another example includes injection of ammonia into the exhaust feedstream upstream of a reduction catalyst. there are infrastructure-related problems associated with storage, transport, and handling of ammonia for a large fleet. furthermore, un-reacted ammonia may pass through the scr and be exhausted into the atmosphere. another example comprises use of urea as a reductant for selective catalytic reduction. such a system requires replenishing urea on-board the vehicle, which requires an infrastructure to distribute the urea. furthermore, the freezing point of the urea solution is ??2Â° c., presenting a problem for its use in cold climates. another example comprises use of nox storage catalysts. these catalysts can be effective, but they typically require a large catalyst volume and a substantial mass of expensive platinum-group metals (e.g., pt, pd, and rh) in combination with extremely low sulfur fuel and periodic intrusive operation of the engine to regenerate the catalyst, thus reducing the effective fuel economy of the vehicle.
hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction (hc-scr) is a technology for reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides in lean exhaust, such as diesel exhaust. one of the significant challenges of implementing hc-scr is to develop a system that allows sufficient reduction of nox emissions over the range of exhaust temperatures found in diesel engines at the speeds and loads experienced during typical, every-day operation. furthermore, it is desirable that the hydrocarbon reductant be present on the vehicle. one source of reductant is the exhaust itself, but typical hydrocarbons present in engine exhaust are generally less active than diesel fuel. the use of diesel fuel and selected diesel fuel-component hydrocarbons as the reductant has been explored by several investigators. results indicate that the nox reduction efficiency of hc-scr catalysts can be greatly improved if appropriate active hydrocarbon species are used. the most effective active species appear to be oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. these oxygenated species are produced by low-temperature oxidation of long, straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons of the type that are present in diesel fuel. also, long, straight-chain alkenes are produced by low-temperature oxidation of these same alkanes, and have been found to be more effective reductants than the long, straight-chain alkanes in some studies.
a system that results in adequate reduction of nox emissions over a range of exhaust temperatures typically found in diesel engines at the speeds and loads experienced in every-day driving, i.e., 200Â° c.-500Â° c., is desirable. a number of hydrocarbons have been shown to be effective for the reduction of nox over silver-alumina (ag/al2o3) and barium-yttria (bay) zeolite catalysts, including long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons, alkene hydrocarbons, and diesel fuel, as well as alcohols and aldehydes.
hydrocarbons present in diesel and gasoline engine exhaust such as methane, ethane, propene, and propane require high temperatures for adequate nox conversion, and are generally not suitable for hc-scr. long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons such as n-octane and n-decane that are present in diesel fuel require somewhat lower temperatures for adequate nox conversion compared to the lighter hydrocarbons. this observation has led to the use of diesel fuel and long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons as the nox reductant in a number of studies. these studies have shown, however, that diesel fuel as well as long, straight-chain hydrocarbons are only adequate above a catalyst temperature of about 300Â° c. (573 k) and low catalyst space velocity. further work has shown that alcohols and aldehydes can reduce nox at catalyst temperatures as low as 200 to 250Â° c. (473 k to 523 k). long, straight-chain alkene hydrocarbons have been found to be effective at temperatures as low as 250 to 300Â° c. (523 k to 573 k). however, these species are not readily available in engine exhaust streams. a method for producing these species on-board the vehicle that leads to efficient selective reduction of nox over the entire desired exhaust temperature range is desireable.
it has been reported that the peak temperature for nox conversion using diesel fuel can be reduced by injecting the diesel fuel into a region upstream of the catalyst that has been preheated to 400Â° c. (673 k) while maintaining a lower catalyst temperature. peak nox conversion efficiencies have been obtained at catalyst temperatures near 300Â° c. (573 k) with this method. it was believed that the diesel fuel was partially oxidized at 400Â° c. (673 k) to form species that were more effective for hc-scr than diesel fuel by itself. the drawback to this method, however, is that supplemental heating of the exhaust may not be suitable for practical engine exhaust systems on a vehicle. ignition improvers, when added to diesel fuel, have been shown to lower the autoignition temperature by lowering the temperature where diesel fuel oxidation begins to take place. a method to take advantage of this lower oxidation temperature to prepare partial oxidation products for use in exhaust hc-scr can be useful.
specific lean-operating engine configurations may employ oxidation catalytic devices immediately downstream of the engine to manage exhaust emissions related to hydrocarbons and particulate matter, and accommodate fuel sulfur. an oxidation catalyst readily oxidizes aldehydes. any aldehydes produced in engine in-cylinder burning are oxidized in the oxidation catalyst and are unavailable for nox reduction in an hc-scr device.
thus, there is a need for a method and system to facilitate hydrocarbon-selective reduction of exhaust gas nox in an aftertreatment system for an engine operating lean of stoichiometry wherein the aftertreatment system includes an oxidation or other catalytic device upstream of the hc-scr device, while addressing issues related thereto.

currently, proposed systems for injecting reductants for selective catalyst reduction of nox require additional hardware and control schemes to accomplish such operation. an example of such a system includes injection of engine fuel into the exhaust stream. the effectiveness of this method decreases significantly at an exhaust temperature below 400Â° c. at the point of injection, and requires an adequate residence time of the reductant in the exhaust feedstream. another example includes injection of ammonia into the exhaust feedstream upstream of a reduction catalyst. there are infrastructure-related problems associated with storage, transport, and handling of ammonia for a large fleet. furthermore, un-reacted ammonia may pass through the scr and be exhausted into the atmosphere. another example comprises use of urea as a reductant for selective catalytic reduction. such a system requires replenishing urea on-board the vehicle, which requires an infrastructure to distribute the urea. furthermore, the freezing point of the urea solution is ??2Â° c., presenting a problem for its use in cold climates. another example comprises use of nox storage catalysts. these catalysts can be effective, but they typically require a large catalyst volume and a substantial mass of expensive platinum-group metals (e.g., pt, pd, and rh) in combination with extremely low sulfur fuel and periodic intrusive operation of the engine to regenerate the catalyst, thus reducing the effective fuel economy of the vehicle.
hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction (hc-scr) is a technology for reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides in lean exhaust, such as diesel exhaust. one of the significant challenges of implementing hc-scr is to develop a system that allows sufficient reduction of nox emissions over the range of exhaust temperatures found in diesel engines at the speeds and loads experienced during typical, every-day operation. furthermore, it is desirable that the hydrocarbon reductant be present on the vehicle. one source of reductant is the exhaust itself, but typical hydrocarbons present in engine exhaust are generally less active than diesel fuel. the use of diesel fuel and selected diesel fuel-component hydrocarbons as the reductant has been explored by several investigators. results indicate that the nox reduction efficiency of hc-scr catalysts can be greatly improved if appropriate active hydrocarbon species are used. the most effective active species appear to be oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. these oxygenated species are produced by low-temperature oxidation of long, straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons of the type that are present in diesel fuel. also, long, straight-chain alkenes are produced by low-temperature oxidation of these same alkanes, and have been found to be more effective reductants than the long, straight-chain alkanes in some studies.
a system that results in adequate reduction of nox emissions over a range of exhaust temperatures typically found in diesel engines at the speeds and loads experienced in every-day driving, i.e., 200Â° c.-500Â° c., is desirable. a number of hydrocarbons have been shown to be effective for the reduction of nox over silver-alumina (ag/al2o3) and barium-yttria (bay) zeolite catalysts, including long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons, alkene hydrocarbons, and diesel fuel, as well as alcohols and aldehydes.
hydrocarbons present in diesel and gasoline engine exhaust such as methane, ethane, propene, and propane require high temperatures for adequate nox conversion, and are generally not suitable for hc-scr. long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons such as n-octane and n-decane that are present in diesel fuel require somewhat lower temperatures for adequate nox conversion compared to the lighter hydrocarbons. this observation has led to the use of diesel fuel and long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons as the nox reductant in a number of studies. these studies have shown, however, that diesel fuel as well as long, straight-chain hydrocarbons are only adequate above a catalyst temperature of about 300Â° c. (573 k) and low catalyst space velocity. further work has shown that alcohols and aldehydes can reduce nox at catalyst temperatures as low as 200 to 250Â° c. (473 k to 523 k). long, straight-chain alkene hydrocarbons have been found to be effective at temperatures as low as 250 to 300Â° c. (523 k to 573 k). however, these species are not readily available in engine exhaust streams. a method for producing these species on-board the vehicle that leads to efficient selective reduction of nox over the entire desired exhaust temperature range is desireable.
it has been reported that the peak temperature for nox conversion using diesel fuel can be reduced by injecting the diesel fuel into a region upstream of the catalyst that has been preheated to 400Â° c. (673 k) while maintaining a lower catalyst temperature. peak nox conversion efficiencies have been obtained at catalyst temperatures near 300Â° c. (573 k) with this method. it was believed that the diesel fuel was partially oxidized at 400Â° c. (673 k) to form species that were more effective for hc-scr than diesel fuel by itself. the drawback to this method, however, is that supplemental heating of the exhaust may not be suitable for practical engine exhaust systems on a vehicle. ignition improvers, when added to diesel fuel, have been shown to lower the autoignition temperature by lowering the temperature where diesel fuel oxidation begins to take place. a method to take advantage of this lower oxidation temperature to prepare partial oxidation products for use in exhaust hc-scr can be useful.
specific lean-operating engine configurations may employ oxidation catalytic devices immediately downstream of the engine to manage exhaust emissions related to hydrocarbons and particulate matter, and accommodate fuel sulfur. an oxidation catalyst readily oxidizes aldehydes. any aldehydes produced in engine in-cylinder burning are oxidized in the oxidation catalyst and are unavailable for nox reduction in an hc-scr device.
thus, there is a need for a method and system to facilitate hydrocarbon-selective reduction of exhaust gas nox in an aftertreatment system for an engine operating lean of stoichiometry wherein the aftertreatment system includes an oxidation or other catalytic device upstream of the hc-scr device, while addressing issues related thereto.
in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a method and apparatus for nox reduction are provided, which address the aforementioned need, comprising an exhaust gas purifying system. the system includes a hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction device, adapted to treat exhaust gas flowing from an internal combustion engine. there is an injector device adapted to inject a blend of fuel and an ignition improver into the exhaust gas at a location upstream of the hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction catalyst. a control module is adapted to control the injector device to inject a quantity of the blended fuel and ignition improver into the exhaust gas when temperature of the exhaust gas at the location of the injection is greater than about 280Â° c.

hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction (hc-scr) is a technology for reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides in lean exhaust, such as diesel exhaust. one of the significant challenges of implementing hc-scr is to develop a system that allows sufficient reduction of nox emissions over the range of exhaust temperatures found in diesel engines at the speeds and loads experienced during typical, every-day operation. furthermore, it is desirable that the hydrocarbon reductant be present on the vehicle. one source of reductant is the exhaust itself, but typical hydrocarbons present in engine exhaust are generally less active than diesel fuel. the use of diesel fuel and selected diesel fuel-component hydrocarbons as the reductant has been explored by several investigators. results indicate that the nox reduction efficiency of hc-scr catalysts can be greatly improved if appropriate active hydrocarbon species are used. the most effective active species appear to be oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. these oxygenated species are produced by low-temperature oxidation of long, straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons of the type that are present in diesel fuel. also, long, straight-chain alkenes are produced by low-temperature oxidation of these same alkanes, and have been found to be more effective reductants than the long, straight-chain alkanes in some studies.
a system that results in adequate reduction of nox emissions over a range of exhaust temperatures typically found in diesel engines at the speeds and loads experienced in every-day driving, i.e., 200Â° c.-500Â° c., is desirable. a number of hydrocarbons have been shown to be effective for the reduction of nox over silver-alumina (ag/al2o3) and barium-yttria (bay) zeolite catalysts, including long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons, alkene hydrocarbons, and diesel fuel, as well as alcohols and aldehydes.
hydrocarbons present in diesel and gasoline engine exhaust such as methane, ethane, propene, and propane require high temperatures for adequate nox conversion, and are generally not suitable for hc-scr. long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons such as n-octane and n-decane that are present in diesel fuel require somewhat lower temperatures for adequate nox conversion compared to the lighter hydrocarbons. this observation has led to the use of diesel fuel and long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons as the nox reductant in a number of studies. these studies have shown, however, that diesel fuel as well as long, straight-chain hydrocarbons are only adequate above a catalyst temperature of about 300Â° c. (573 k) and low catalyst space velocity. further work has shown that alcohols and aldehydes can reduce nox at catalyst temperatures as low as 200 to 250Â° c. (473 k to 523 k). long, straight-chain alkene hydrocarbons have been found to be effective at temperatures as low as 250 to 300Â° c. (523 k to 573 k). however, these species are not readily available in engine exhaust streams. a method for producing these species on-board the vehicle that leads to efficient selective reduction of nox over the entire desired exhaust temperature range is desireable.
it has been reported that the peak temperature for nox conversion using diesel fuel can be reduced by injecting the diesel fuel into a region upstream of the catalyst that has been preheated to 400Â° c. (673 k) while maintaining a lower catalyst temperature. peak nox conversion efficiencies have been obtained at catalyst temperatures near 300Â° c. (573 k) with this method. it was believed that the diesel fuel was partially oxidized at 400Â° c. (673 k) to form species that were more effective for hc-scr than diesel fuel by itself. the drawback to this method, however, is that supplemental heating of the exhaust may not be suitable for practical engine exhaust systems on a vehicle. ignition improvers, when added to diesel fuel, have been shown to lower the autoignition temperature by lowering the temperature where diesel fuel oxidation begins to take place. a method to take advantage of this lower oxidation temperature to prepare partial oxidation products for use in exhaust hc-scr can be useful.
specific lean-operating engine configurations may employ oxidation catalytic devices immediately downstream of the engine to manage exhaust emissions related to hydrocarbons and particulate matter, and accommodate fuel sulfur. an oxidation catalyst readily oxidizes aldehydes. any aldehydes produced in engine in-cylinder burning are oxidized in the oxidation catalyst and are unavailable for nox reduction in an hc-scr device.
thus, there is a need for a method and system to facilitate hydrocarbon-selective reduction of exhaust gas nox in an aftertreatment system for an engine operating lean of stoichiometry wherein the aftertreatment system includes an oxidation or other catalytic device upstream of the hc-scr device, while addressing issues related thereto.
in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a method and apparatus for nox reduction are provided, which address the aforementioned need, comprising an exhaust gas purifying system. the system includes a hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction device, adapted to treat exhaust gas flowing from an internal combustion engine. there is an injector device adapted to inject a blend of fuel and an ignition improver into the exhaust gas at a location upstream of the hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction catalyst. a control module is adapted to control the injector device to inject a quantity of the blended fuel and ignition improver into the exhaust gas when temperature of the exhaust gas at the location of the injection is greater than about 280Â° c.

hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction (hc-scr) is a technology for reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides in lean exhaust, such as diesel exhaust. one of the significant challenges of implementing hc-scr is to develop a system that allows sufficient reduction of nox emissions over the range of exhaust temperatures found in diesel engines at the speeds and loads experienced during typical, every-day operation. furthermore, it is desirable that the hydrocarbon reductant be present on the vehicle. one source of reductant is the exhaust itself, but typical hydrocarbons present in engine exhaust are generally less active than diesel fuel. the use of diesel fuel and selected diesel fuel-component hydrocarbons as the reductant has been explored by several investigators. results indicate that the nox reduction efficiency of hc-scr catalysts can be greatly improved if appropriate active hydrocarbon species are used. the most effective active species appear to be oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. these oxygenated species are produced by low-temperature oxidation of long, straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons of the type that are present in diesel fuel. also, long, straight-chain alkenes are produced by low-temperature oxidation of these same alkanes, and have been found to be more effective reductants than the long, straight-chain alkanes in some studies.
a system that results in adequate reduction of nox emissions over a range of exhaust temperatures typically found in diesel engines at the speeds and loads experienced in every-day driving, i.e., 200Â° c.-500Â° c., is desirable. a number of hydrocarbons have been shown to be effective for the reduction of nox over silver-alumina (ag/al2o3) and barium-yttria (bay) zeolite catalysts, including long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons, alkene hydrocarbons, and diesel fuel, as well as alcohols and aldehydes.
hydrocarbons present in diesel and gasoline engine exhaust such as methane, ethane, propene, and propane require high temperatures for adequate nox conversion, and are generally not suitable for hc-scr. long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons such as n-octane and n-decane that are present in diesel fuel require somewhat lower temperatures for adequate nox conversion compared to the lighter hydrocarbons. this observation has led to the use of diesel fuel and long straight-chain alkane hydrocarbons as the nox reductant in a number of studies. these studies have shown, however, that diesel fuel as well as long, straight-chain hydrocarbons are only adequate above a catalyst temperature of about 300Â° c. (573 k) and low catalyst space velocity. further work has shown that alcohols and aldehydes can reduce nox at catalyst temperatures as low as 200 to 250Â° c. (473 k to 523 k). long, straight-chain alkene hydrocarbons have been found to be effective at temperatures as low as 250 to 300Â° c. (523 k to 573 k). however, these species are not readily available in engine exhaust streams. a method for producing these species on-board the vehicle that leads to efficient selective reduction of nox over the entire desired exhaust temperature range is desireable.
it has been reported that the peak temperature for nox conversion using diesel fuel can be reduced by injecting the diesel fuel into a region upstream of the catalyst that has been preheated to 400Â° c. (673 k) while maintaining a lower catalyst temperature. peak nox conversion efficiencies have been obtained at catalyst temperatures near 300Â° c. (573 k) with this method. it was believed that the diesel fuel was partially oxidized at 400Â° c. (673 k) to form species that were more effective for hc-scr than diesel fuel by itself. the drawback to this method, however, is that supplemental heating of the exhaust may not be suitable for practical engine exhaust systems on a vehicle. ignition improvers, when added to diesel fuel, have been shown to lower the autoignition temperature by lowering the temperature where diesel fuel oxidation begins to take place. a method to take advantage of this lower oxidation temperature to prepare partial oxidation products for use in exhaust hc-scr can be useful.
specific lean-operating engine configurations may employ oxidation catalytic devices immediately downstream of the engine to manage exhaust emissions related to hydrocarbons and particulate matter, and accommodate fuel sulfur. an oxidation catalyst readily oxidizes aldehydes. any aldehydes produced in engine in-cylinder burning are oxidized in the oxidation catalyst and are unavailable for nox reduction in an hc-scr device.
thus, there is a need for a method and system to facilitate hydrocarbon-selective reduction of exhaust gas nox in an aftertreatment system for an engine operating lean of stoichiometry wherein the aftertreatment system includes an oxidation or other catalytic device upstream of the hc-scr device, while addressing issues related thereto.
in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a method and apparatus for nox reduction are provided, which address the aforementioned need, comprising an exhaust gas purifying system. the system includes a hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction device, adapted to treat exhaust gas flowing from an internal combustion engine. there is an injector device adapted to inject a blend of fuel and an ignition improver into the exhaust gas at a location upstream of the hydrocarbon-selective catalytic reduction catalyst. a control module is adapted to control the injector device to inject a quantity of the blended fuel and ignition improver into the exhaust gas when temperature of the exhaust gas at the location of the injection is greater than about 280Â° c.

it can consist in increasing the temperature of the filter above 550Â° c., generally by temporarily raising the air/fuel ratio of the exhaust gases flowing therethrough without a ratio 1 being reached, and in obtaining an oxidizing composition of these gases to achieve combustion of the particles retained in this filter.
this involves the major drawback of increasing the fuel consumption.
another technique consists, as described more in detail in european patent ep-0,341,832, in arranging a catalyst for oxidizing the nitrogen monoxide (no) upstream from the filter. this catalyst oxidizes the nitrogen monoxide contained in the exhaust gases to nitrogen dioxide (no2) and this nitrogen dioxide is then used to allow combustion of the particles trapped on the filter at a temperature ranging between 280Â° c. and 400Â° c.
this technique requires a diesel fuel with a very low sulfur content (of the order of 50 ppm) to maintain a sufficient conversion efficiency of the oxidation catalyst so as to obtain a large amount of no converted to no2.
other techniques involve a chemical process wherein organometallic additives, such as cerium for example, are added to the diesel fuel so as to obtain combustion of the particles present in the filter at a temperature close to 400Â° c. to 450Â° c.
using such additives is quite costly and requires a particular device for feeding these additives notably into a diesel fuel tank.
it is also well known to heat these exhaust gases by means of additional devices arranged in the exhaust line and upstream from the filter, such as burners or resistors, as described more in detail in patents fr-2,753,393 and fr-2,755,623 filed by the applicant.
in this configuration, it is necessary to provide a high amount of heat energy to the exhaust gases, either by burning a large amount of fuel when using a burner, or by using a high electric power in the case of resistors.
the major drawback thereof is that it significantly increases the fuel consumption of the engine and decreases the driving comfort.

US07651555,onsite chemistry air filtration system,"an onsite chemistry air filtration system to remove gaseous contaminants from air is disclosed. the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention comprises: a conventional particulate filtration section, a photochemical filtration section, a static gas phase filtration section and a catalytic filtration section. the conventional particulate filtration section captures solids and condensables. in the photochemical filtration section, uv lamps generate bio-destruction and surface photochemical activity on a semiconductor catalyst material, provide a radiation source to irradiate airborne contaminant molecules and to energize their states to promote reactions and generate airborne ozone and radicals. in the static gas phase filtration section, gas phase filtration media is used to capture contaminants, concentrate them in a relatively confined space and allow airborne generated chemistries to concentrate and react in-situ, thereby creating a regeneration effect on the media. in the catalytic filtration section, catalytic media scavenges and converts airborne radicals and ozone to harmless by-products.","the present invention relates generally to the field of air filtration and purification and, more particularly, to a complete onsite chemistry air filtration system that enables reactant chemistries to be dynamically generated, contained and controlled onsite for the purpose of removing undesirable contaminants from air. the present invention synthesizes multiple technologies to achieve this end.
airborne particulate filtration has existed for perhaps hundreds of years with the goal of removing solid particulates from air, typically using a filter comprising a fine web of porous media through which the solid particulates cannot pass, yet gaseous molecules can pass. the size of the pores in the filter media determines the efficiency of the filter (efficiency in this case referring to the maximum sized particulate that may pass through the filter). such filters sometimes are charged or enhanced with an electrostatic field to increase particulate removal efficiency without reducing media pore size, which would undesirably increase the gas flow pressure drop across the media. nevertheless, such filters still allow gases to pass through.
gas phase filtration was introduced in the 1960s to remove gases from the airstream using dry media. in gas phase filtration systems, media is selected to suit the particular contaminant(s) and is usually carbon- or alumina-based. media may be activated through processing treatments and may be impregnated with additional chemistry to increase capacity and selectiveness of removal.
most current commercial gas phase filtration applications use either carbon or alumina impregnated with potassium permanganate. carbon acts by attracting and loosely holding undesirable airborne chemicals. permanganate impregnated alumina acts as an oxidation media and chemically changes contaminant gases to more stable molecules of their component parts.
however, some chemicals, such as ammonia, require reduction chemistry for removal and, therefore, such chemicals typically have been ignored by prior art filtration systems due to the fact that a completely separate stage of media would be required. additionally, the capacity for impregnated and activated static media is finite and presents a time-consuming and expensive limitation to the prior art.
in gas phase filtration systems, a certain amount of residence time (the time the gas is exposed to the filtration media) is required, and once the reactive media depth is reduced, residence time also may be reduced below an acceptable figure, resulting in gas bypass and breakthrough. thus, once the filtration media has been reacted or saturated, the removal efficiency of the filtration system drops significantly. in order to maintain high removal efficiency rates, it is necessary to discard a substantial amount of media, which may be only marginally used. discarding media that is only partially used unnecessarily increases costs.
ultraviolet (?œuv?? light in selective wavelengths has been found to have favorable properties in air filtration. for example, in certain wavelengths it can act destructively on thymine in microorganism dna, thus preventing replication. radiation also can be absorbed by molecules ?œin transit??through an air filtration system, creating energized state where chemical reactions are far more likely to occur. several paths are possible for a return to a less active state.
further, in photochemical reactions, uv radiation (generally less than 385 nm) absorbed on the surface of a photocatalytic material generates highly reactive electrons and holes. photocatalytic adsorbates with suitable redox potentials undergo electron transfer processes at the material surface. for example, uv radiation promotes electrons from the valence band into the conduction band of a titanium dioxide semiconductor photocatalytic material. in an air filtration context, destruction of volatile organic compounds (?œvocs?? takes place through reactions with molecular oxygen or through reactions with hydroxyl radicals and super-oxide ions formed after the initial production of highly reactive electron and hole pairs.
additionally, and quite importantly in the present invention, uv light in the vacuum-ultraviolet (?œvuv?? range (less than 200 nm) also generates ozone and almost completely breaks down water molecules to h and oh. the latter hydroxyl radical is one of the most powerful oxidizing agents known with an eÂ°=+2.7 v in acid solution.
the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention marries and synthesizes a number air technologies to create the unique synergistic effect?”a single, complete air filtration system that uses complementary chemical processes to dynamically generate, contain and control reactant chemistries. no air filtration system known in the prior art offers such a complete system.
accordingly, there exists a need for an improved air filtration system to overcome the limitations found in the prior art and to create a nearly self-sustaining device. desirably, the air filtration system is configured to advantageously combine a series of air filtration methods and technologies in sequence for filtering a wide array of gaseous contaminants. more desirably, the air filtration methods and technologies in such a system complement one another to dynamically generate, contain and control the reactant chemistries of the air filtration methods and technologies. most desirably, such a system may be easily installed and retrofit into existing air handling systems.
the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention is a complete system for filtering a wide array of broad-spectrum gaseous contaminants on a dynamic and continuous basis. additionally, in some embodiments, the system of the present invention has significant biological contaminant reduction capabilities, for reducing airborne bio-matter, such as bacteria, molds and viral matter.
the arrangement and sequence of the filtration and chemical processes of the system, and the dynamic onsite chemistry generation of the system, result in a very high system removal efficiency, and the system maintains straight-line removal efficiency for long periods of time.
until now, the standard approach to filtering multiple gas phase chemistries from indoor air was to trap them on carbon, react them with a chemical on carbon or activated alumina, or to use a liquid system with chemicals and pass the air through the liquid phase to react with the gas phase. these approaches all suffer from the inherent limitations of the chemistries initially installed in the systems. to keep such systems working at peak capability the media or chemical needs to be replaced, and replaced frequently if the contaminant loading is high. this is expensive both in terms of media costs and labor, and time to do the replacing. moreover, the activity levels of impregnated media are also lower than dynamically generated chemistry.
in the preferred embodiment, the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention comprises the following general components: a conventional particulate filtration section, a photochemical filtration section, a static gas phase filtration section and a catalytic filtration section.
the conventional particulate filtration section captures solids and condensables. the present invention incorporates the ability to remove all airborne particles with a sequence of filters up to merv (?œminimum efficiency reporting value?? 14 efficiency that protects the downstream chemistry sections of the invention.
in the photochemical filtration section, uv lamps generate bio-destruction and surface photochemical activity on a photocatalytic material. in the preferred embodiment, the photocatalytic material is a semiconductor catalyst. the surface chemistry of the semiconductor catalyst is dynamic and provides oxidation and reduction chemistry. in some embodiments of the present invention, the semiconductor catalyst surface also may be charged electrostatically to enhance capture rate of large molecules and bio-matter.
the photochemical filtration section also includes uv lamps that provide a radiation source to irradiate airborne molecules passing through the section and to energize their states to promote reactions. finally, the photochemical filtration section includes additional uv lamps and/or other ozone and radical generation devices (such as corona discharge) that are used to generate airborne chemistry, including ozone, hydroxyl radicals, hydroperoxides, peroxides, super-oxides and others. such ozone and radical generation devices may or may not be in the airstream.
in one embodiment of the present invention, the photochemical filtration section also may contain electrostatic plates configured to capture particulate matter. the plates contain such matter and allow the matter to be irradiated by the uv lamps for an almost infinite residence time. such an embodiment typically is used in applications and environments in which bio-matter, such as bacteria, molds, spores, viral and miscellaneous loose bio-matter must be captured and destroyed. destruction of such matter is more complete in situ rather than in transit because the relatively short radiation exposure time in transit generally is insufficient to adequately break down such matter.
in the static gas phase filtration section, filtration media is used to capture contaminants, concentrate them in a relatively confined space and allow airborne generated chemistries to concentrate and react in-situ. this media is stable and represents a reaction zone where chemicals can be broken down, without transit time constraints, to harmless by-products. this media also is capable of on-site regeneration in situations where airborne chemistry supply exceeds contaminant demand. the static gas phase filtration section may include first stage and second stage filtration sections, if necessary, the second phase filtration section configured to capture any by-products of the upstream reactions (the composition of such beds being dependent on particular gases to be treated).
in the catalytic filtration section, media that has catalytic properties on airborne chemistry scavenges and converts airborne radicals and ozone to harmless by-products such as water vapor and oxygen. the catalytic filtration section additionally may include particulate filtration to capture any initial dust from the various media beds.
sensors are provided in the preferred embodiment of the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention to enable monitoring of various operating parameters. these sensors provide safety for supply side air and allow the dynamic chemistry production to be managed to meet demand. for example, an ozone sensor allows downstream ozone concentration to be measured in real time. also, a humidity sensor and control may also be included to maintain proper levels of water in the air depending on the particular system operational environment, and to prevent the dynamic chemistry generation from being operated in undesirable conditions. the system may further include a device to monitor, in real time, the condition of the air entering and/or leaving the system as well as the overall operation and efficiency of the system.
additionally, various safety devices, such as temperature monitors in the media beds of the static gas phase filtration section may be included. in the preferred embodiment, a temperature monitor in the media bed of the first stage filtration section of the static gas phase filtration allows the temperature of the media bed to be monitored and prevented from reaching unsafe levels. however, other embodiments of the present invention may optionally include monitors in any of the media beds in the static gas phase filtration section.
the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention may include a fan if it is installed as a freestanding unit outside of an air handling system. however, a fan may be unnecessary when the air filtration system of the present invention is integrated with other air handling equipment, as typically may be found in most commercial applications.
different embodiments of the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention may include different combinations of the preceding components as necessary for a particular application or environment. it will be understood that the present disclosure encompasses all such combinations and embodiments.
a key to the present invention is the process of photochemistry, which is used to generate reactive chemicals for remediation of the contaminants in-situ in the air, on the surface of the semiconductor catalyst and in the subsequent static gas phase stages that follow the photochemical filtration section. using uv light in the photochemical filtration section with a selected spectrum from 85-300 nm creates several advantageous results.
first, various reactive radicals are created to destroy airborne contaminants on contact. second, various chemistries are created that travel from the photochemical filtration section to the subsequent static gas phase filtration section and react with contaminants trapped in the media bed(s) of the static gas phase filtration section to enhance the efficiency of the static gas phase filtration section by creating a regenerative effect on the media bed(s) third, the semiconductor catalyst is activated, creating electrons and holes on the surface of the catalyst that are capable of both reducing and oxidizing chemicals that come in contact with the catalyst. and, fourth, photons are generated that are absorbed by a species. absorption of photons causes electrons to transfer to outer valance bands, gain activity and, often, behave as different species. this process extends the active life of the media in the static gas phase filtration section.
marrying gas phase filtration with photochemical filtration eliminates the disadvantage of using photochemical filtration only, as has been done in the prior art, which can generate noxious and harmful by-products that are partial reductions or oxidations of complex molecules. only by trapping and continuing the destruction of such molecules can the airstream be fully remediated.
the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention is fully scalable and can be used in myriad applications, include residential and low rise buildings, commercial offices and places of business (including high rise buildings), casinos (primarily to address environmental tobacco smoke (?œets??), ships (for bio, chemical and odor control), military (for chemical and biological control, including mobile, portable or fixed equipment), secure buildings (for total contaminant control), airports, mass transit vehicles (such as buses, railcars and airplanes), automobiles and mining (and other mobile equipment housing personnel).
the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention creates an air purification device that has many times the stoichiometric capacity for gaseous contaminant removal of media-only systems, on-site regeneration of media in the static gas phase filtration section, higher removal efficiency, oxidation and reduction chemistry and benign by-products. it is also possible to provide gaseous filtration ?œon demand.??benefits of the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention include reduced energy consumption for buildings, cleaner air, lower filtration system and building operating costs, greatly reduced media consumption, broader spectrum chemical removal capacity, easier installation with side stream air scrubbers, ease of retrofitting existing installations and easily ?œmanaged??air cleaning and ventilation.

the conventional particulate filtration section captures solids and condensables. the present invention incorporates the ability to remove all airborne particles with a sequence of filters up to merv (?œminimum efficiency reporting value?? 14 efficiency that protects the downstream chemistry sections of the invention.
in the photochemical filtration section, uv lamps generate bio-destruction and surface photochemical activity on a photocatalytic material. in the preferred embodiment, the photocatalytic material is a semiconductor catalyst. the surface chemistry of the semiconductor catalyst is dynamic and provides oxidation and reduction chemistry. in some embodiments of the present invention, the semiconductor catalyst surface also may be charged electrostatically to enhance capture rate of large molecules and bio-matter.
the photochemical filtration section also includes uv lamps that provide a radiation source to irradiate airborne molecules passing through the section and to energize their states to promote reactions. finally, the photochemical filtration section includes additional uv lamps and/or other ozone and radical generation devices (such as corona discharge) that are used to generate airborne chemistry, including ozone, hydroxyl radicals, hydroperoxides, peroxides, super-oxides and others. such ozone and radical generation devices may or may not be in the airstream.
in one embodiment of the present invention, the photochemical filtration section also may contain electrostatic plates configured to capture particulate matter. the plates contain such matter and allow the matter to be irradiated by the uv lamps for an almost infinite residence time. such an embodiment typically is used in applications and environments in which bio-matter, such as bacteria, molds, spores, viral and miscellaneous loose bio-matter must be captured and destroyed. destruction of such matter is more complete in situ rather than in transit because the relatively short radiation exposure time in transit generally is insufficient to adequately break down such matter.
in the static gas phase filtration section, filtration media is used to capture contaminants, concentrate them in a relatively confined space and allow airborne generated chemistries to concentrate and react in-situ. this media is stable and represents a reaction zone where chemicals can be broken down, without transit time constraints, to harmless by-products. this media also is capable of on-site regeneration in situations where airborne chemistry supply exceeds contaminant demand. the static gas phase filtration section may include first stage and second stage filtration sections, if necessary, the second phase filtration section configured to capture any by-products of the upstream reactions (the composition of such beds being dependent on particular gases to be treated).
in the catalytic filtration section, media that has catalytic properties on airborne chemistry scavenges and converts airborne radicals and ozone to harmless by-products such as water vapor and oxygen. the catalytic filtration section additionally may include particulate filtration to capture any initial dust from the various media beds.
sensors are provided in the preferred embodiment of the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention to enable monitoring of various operating parameters. these sensors provide safety for supply side air and allow the dynamic chemistry production to be managed to meet demand. for example, an ozone sensor allows downstream ozone concentration to be measured in real time. also, a humidity sensor and control may also be included to maintain proper levels of water in the air depending on the particular system operational environment, and to prevent the dynamic chemistry generation from being operated in undesirable conditions. the system may further include a device to monitor, in real time, the condition of the air entering and/or leaving the system as well as the overall operation and efficiency of the system.
additionally, various safety devices, such as temperature monitors in the media beds of the static gas phase filtration section may be included. in the preferred embodiment, a temperature monitor in the media bed of the first stage filtration section of the static gas phase filtration allows the temperature of the media bed to be monitored and prevented from reaching unsafe levels. however, other embodiments of the present invention may optionally include monitors in any of the media beds in the static gas phase filtration section.
the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention may include a fan if it is installed as a freestanding unit outside of an air handling system. however, a fan may be unnecessary when the air filtration system of the present invention is integrated with other air handling equipment, as typically may be found in most commercial applications.
different embodiments of the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention may include different combinations of the preceding components as necessary for a particular application or environment. it will be understood that the present disclosure encompasses all such combinations and embodiments.
a key to the present invention is the process of photochemistry, which is used to generate reactive chemicals for remediation of the contaminants in-situ in the air, on the surface of the semiconductor catalyst and in the subsequent static gas phase stages that follow the photochemical filtration section. using uv light in the photochemical filtration section with a selected spectrum from 85-300 nm creates several advantageous results.
first, various reactive radicals are created to destroy airborne contaminants on contact. second, various chemistries are created that travel from the photochemical filtration section to the subsequent static gas phase filtration section and react with contaminants trapped in the media bed(s) of the static gas phase filtration section to enhance the efficiency of the static gas phase filtration section by creating a regenerative effect on the media bed(s) third, the semiconductor catalyst is activated, creating electrons and holes on the surface of the catalyst that are capable of both reducing and oxidizing chemicals that come in contact with the catalyst. and, fourth, photons are generated that are absorbed by a species. absorption of photons causes electrons to transfer to outer valance bands, gain activity and, often, behave as different species. this process extends the active life of the media in the static gas phase filtration section.
marrying gas phase filtration with photochemical filtration eliminates the disadvantage of using photochemical filtration only, as has been done in the prior art, which can generate noxious and harmful by-products that are partial reductions or oxidations of complex molecules. only by trapping and continuing the destruction of such molecules can the airstream be fully remediated.
the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention is fully scalable and can be used in myriad applications, include residential and low rise buildings, commercial offices and places of business (including high rise buildings), casinos (primarily to address environmental tobacco smoke (?œets??), ships (for bio, chemical and odor control), military (for chemical and biological control, including mobile, portable or fixed equipment), secure buildings (for total contaminant control), airports, mass transit vehicles (such as buses, railcars and airplanes), automobiles and mining (and other mobile equipment housing personnel).
the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention creates an air purification device that has many times the stoichiometric capacity for gaseous contaminant removal of media-only systems, on-site regeneration of media in the static gas phase filtration section, higher removal efficiency, oxidation and reduction chemistry and benign by-products. it is also possible to provide gaseous filtration ?œon demand.??benefits of the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention include reduced energy consumption for buildings, cleaner air, lower filtration system and building operating costs, greatly reduced media consumption, broader spectrum chemical removal capacity, easier installation with side stream air scrubbers, ease of retrofitting existing installations and easily ?œmanaged??air cleaning and ventilation.

US07651555,onsite chemistry air filtration system,"an onsite chemistry air filtration system to remove gaseous contaminants from air is disclosed. the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention comprises: a conventional particulate filtration section, a photochemical filtration section, a static gas phase filtration section and a catalytic filtration section. the conventional particulate filtration section captures solids and condensables. in the photochemical filtration section, uv lamps generate bio-destruction and surface photochemical activity on a semiconductor catalyst material, provide a radiation source to irradiate airborne contaminant molecules and to energize their states to promote reactions and generate airborne ozone and radicals. in the static gas phase filtration section, gas phase filtration media is used to capture contaminants, concentrate them in a relatively confined space and allow airborne generated chemistries to concentrate and react in-situ, thereby creating a regeneration effect on the media. in the catalytic filtration section, catalytic media scavenges and converts airborne radicals and ozone to harmless by-products.","the present invention relates generally to the field of air filtration and purification and, more particularly, to a complete onsite chemistry air filtration system that enables reactant chemistries to be dynamically generated, contained and controlled onsite for the purpose of removing undesirable contaminants from air. the present invention synthesizes multiple technologies to achieve this end.
airborne particulate filtration has existed for perhaps hundreds of years with the goal of removing solid particulates from air, typically using a filter comprising a fine web of porous media through which the solid particulates cannot pass, yet gaseous molecules can pass. the size of the pores in the filter media determines the efficiency of the filter (efficiency in this case referring to the maximum sized particulate that may pass through the filter). such filters sometimes are charged or enhanced with an electrostatic field to increase particulate removal efficiency without reducing media pore size, which would undesirably increase the gas flow pressure drop across the media. nevertheless, such filters still allow gases to pass through.
gas phase filtration was introduced in the 1960s to remove gases from the airstream using dry media. in gas phase filtration systems, media is selected to suit the particular contaminant(s) and is usually carbon- or alumina-based. media may be activated through processing treatments and may be impregnated with additional chemistry to increase capacity and selectiveness of removal.
most current commercial gas phase filtration applications use either carbon or alumina impregnated with potassium permanganate. carbon acts by attracting and loosely holding undesirable airborne chemicals. permanganate impregnated alumina acts as an oxidation media and chemically changes contaminant gases to more stable molecules of their component parts.
however, some chemicals, such as ammonia, require reduction chemistry for removal and, therefore, such chemicals typically have been ignored by prior art filtration systems due to the fact that a completely separate stage of media would be required. additionally, the capacity for impregnated and activated static media is finite and presents a time-consuming and expensive limitation to the prior art.
in gas phase filtration systems, a certain amount of residence time (the time the gas is exposed to the filtration media) is required, and once the reactive media depth is reduced, residence time also may be reduced below an acceptable figure, resulting in gas bypass and breakthrough. thus, once the filtration media has been reacted or saturated, the removal efficiency of the filtration system drops significantly. in order to maintain high removal efficiency rates, it is necessary to discard a substantial amount of media, which may be only marginally used. discarding media that is only partially used unnecessarily increases costs.
ultraviolet (?œuv?? light in selective wavelengths has been found to have favorable properties in air filtration. for example, in certain wavelengths it can act destructively on thymine in microorganism dna, thus preventing replication. radiation also can be absorbed by molecules ?œin transit??through an air filtration system, creating energized state where chemical reactions are far more likely to occur. several paths are possible for a return to a less active state.
further, in photochemical reactions, uv radiation (generally less than 385 nm) absorbed on the surface of a photocatalytic material generates highly reactive electrons and holes. photocatalytic adsorbates with suitable redox potentials undergo electron transfer processes at the material surface. for example, uv radiation promotes electrons from the valence band into the conduction band of a titanium dioxide semiconductor photocatalytic material. in an air filtration context, destruction of volatile organic compounds (?œvocs?? takes place through reactions with molecular oxygen or through reactions with hydroxyl radicals and super-oxide ions formed after the initial production of highly reactive electron and hole pairs.
additionally, and quite importantly in the present invention, uv light in the vacuum-ultraviolet (?œvuv?? range (less than 200 nm) also generates ozone and almost completely breaks down water molecules to h and oh. the latter hydroxyl radical is one of the most powerful oxidizing agents known with an eÂ°=+2.7 v in acid solution.
the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention marries and synthesizes a number air technologies to create the unique synergistic effect?”a single, complete air filtration system that uses complementary chemical processes to dynamically generate, contain and control reactant chemistries. no air filtration system known in the prior art offers such a complete system.
accordingly, there exists a need for an improved air filtration system to overcome the limitations found in the prior art and to create a nearly self-sustaining device. desirably, the air filtration system is configured to advantageously combine a series of air filtration methods and technologies in sequence for filtering a wide array of gaseous contaminants. more desirably, the air filtration methods and technologies in such a system complement one another to dynamically generate, contain and control the reactant chemistries of the air filtration methods and technologies. most desirably, such a system may be easily installed and retrofit into existing air handling systems.
the onsite chemistry air filtration system of the present invention is a complete system for filtering a wide array of broad-spectrum gaseous contaminants on a dynamic and continuous basis. additionally, in some embodiments, the system of the present invention has significant biological contaminant reduction capabilities, for reducing airborne bio-matter, such as bacteria, molds and viral matter.
the arrangement and sequence of the filtration and chemical processes of the system, and the dynamic onsite chemistry generation of the system, result in a very high system removal efficiency, and the system maintains straight-line removal efficiency for long periods of time.

however, a lot of particulate matter (pm) in which unburned hydrocarbons are united with soot is discharged from these diesel engines using heavy oil or light gas oil as its fuel to be the main cause behind the pollution and a social problem. various industries such as diesel engine makers and car makers undergo researches into and developments in the removal of pm and have made studies and inventions concerning filters having excellent ability of removing pm, prefilter oxidation catalysts and dp (diesel particulate) filters (dpf) so devised that the filter is made to carry an oxidation catalyst to oxidize nitrogen monoxide (no) in exhaust gas into nitrogen dioxide (no2) to burn soot, in order to prevent or retard clogging with soot for a long period of time (non-patent document 1, for example).

the aforementioned conventional technologies have high dp calcining efficiency and superior performances. these technologies, however, have the following problems in the case of the exhaust gas using light oil or heavy oil as a fuel and in the case of applying these technologies to stationary generators using de. (i) these filters are operated based on the fundamental principle that pm is removed by filtration utilizing fine pores and therefore have a large draft loss, and often impair the characteristics of de having high efficiency.

methods have long been sought to reduce the deleterious effects of air pollution caused by byproducts resulting from imperfect high-temperature combustion of organic materials. when combustion occurs in the presence of excess air and at high temperatures, harmful byproducts, such as nitrogen oxides, commonly known as nox, are created. nox and subsequent derivatives have been suggested to play a major role in the formation of ground-level ozone that is associated with asthma and other respiratory ailments. nox also contributes to soot formation, which is linked to a number of serious health effects, as well as to acid rain and the deterioration of coastal estuaries. as a result, nox emissions are subject to many regulatory provisions limiting the amount of nox that may be present in effluent gas vented into the surrounding environment.
one known method for dealing with nox involves the use of selective catalytic reduction (scr) to reduce nox to nitrogen gas (n2), using ammonia (nh3) as a reductant. however, as ammonia's own hazardous consequences are well known, the use of nh3 in an scr system presents additional environmental and other problems that must also be addressed. as regulatory agencies continue to drive limits on nox emission lower, other regulations are also driving down the permissible levels of nh3 that may be emitted into the atmosphere. because of regulatory limits on ammonia, the use of hydrocarbons and/or their oxygen derivatives for nox reduction in an scr process is very attractive. numerous catalysts have been suggested for this purpose, including zeolites, perovskites, and metals on metal oxide catalyst support. however, existing catalyst systems have either low activity or a narrow region of working temperatures, or low stability to water, which are detrimental to practical use. u.s. pat. no. 6,703,343 teaches catalyst systems for use in nox reduction. however, these catalyst systems require a specially synthesized metal oxide catalyst support with a very low level of impurities. other catalyst systems known to reduce nox have exhibited very little control over the products formed from the reduction, and in particular, exhibit poor selectivity towards n2 as a product. therefore, there is a need for an effective catalyst system to reduce nox emissions, which system is stable and operable over a wide range of temperatures.
in one embodiment, the invention provides a catalyst system for the reduction of nox, comprising (i) a catalyst in a first zone; said catalyst comprising a first catalyst support, a first catalytic metal comprising gallium, and at least one promoting metal selected from the group consisting of silver, gold, vanadium, zinc, tin, bismuth, cobalt, molybdenum, tungsten, indium and mixtures thereof; (ii) a catalyst in a second zone following said first zone; said catalyst comprising a second catalyst support and a zeolite material; and (iii) a gas stream comprising nox and an organic reductant. the organic reductant can comprise oxygen, nitrogen, or a combination of oxygen and nitrogen. the organic reductant can alternatively comprise a hydrocarbon material. the catalysts in the first zone and second zone are substantially separated from each other.
in another embodiment, the invention provides a method for reducing nox, which comprises the steps of (a) providing a gas stream comprising nox and an organic reductant, as described herein; and (b) contacting said gas stream with a catalyst system, wherein said catalyst system comprises (i) a catalyst in a first zone; said catalyst comprising a first catalyst support, a first catalytic metal comprising gallium, and at least one promoting metal selected from the group consisting of silver, gold, vanadium, zinc, tin, bismuth, cobalt, molybdenum, tungsten, and indium; and (ii) a catalyst in a second zone following said first zone; said catalyst comprising a second catalyst support, and a zeolite material. various other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent with reference to the following description and appended claims.",1,problem,nitrogen oxide emissions,1.0,exact,-1

this invention is especially suitable for the denitration of cold exhaust gases discharged from the outlets of existing exhaust gas denitration apparatus, boilers and the like.
moreover, this invention also relates to the removal of nitrogen oxides present in ventilation gases produced in road tunnels, underground parking spaces, street crossings and the like, and more particularly to a low-temperature denitration technique in which nitrogen oxides having a lower concentration (typically about 15 ppm or less) and a low temperature (typically ordinary temperature to about 50Â° c.) as compared with exhaust gases from boilers and the like can be efficiently reduced and thereby decomposed to nitrogen and water.
furthermore, this invention also relates to denitration systems using a heat-treated active carbon for the removal of nitrogen oxides (nox) present in exhaust gases discharged from boilers, gas turbines, engines and combustion furnaces for burning various types of fuel. the present invention can be suitably used for the removal of nitrogen oxides present in tunnels and for the removal of nitrogen oxides present in exhaust gases from nitric acid production plants.
for the denitration of exhaust gases from stationary nitrogen oxide-producing sources such as boilers, a method for reducing nitrogen oxides selectively by using vanadium oxide as a catalyst and ammonia as a reducing agent (i.e., the scr method) has conventionally been known and is widely employed for practical purposes (?œtechniques and regulations for the prevention of environmental pollution?? volume on the atmosphere, p. 130, maruzen co., ltd.). however, in this method using the vanadium oxide catalyst, the temperature of exhaust gas needs to be raised to 300Â° c. or above in order to achieve a practically sufficient degree of denitration. consequently, it is necessary to install a denitrator containing a catalyst bed in the high-temperature section of the boiler (e.g., just behind the outlet of the boiler or in the heat transfer section of the boiler), or reheat cold exhaust gas and thereby raise its temperature. however, these techniques involve the following problems.
when the denitrator is installed in the high-temperature section of the boiler, various problems arise in that the overall equipment becomes complicated, the use of a heat-resisting material causes an increase in equipment cost, and workability for replacement of the catalyst bed is reduced. when cold exhaust gas is reheated, an additional heater is required, resulting in an increase in equipment cost.
accordingly, a first object of the present invention is to provide a technique by which the denitration of exhaust gases from stationary nitrogen oxide-producing sources such as boilers can be performed at low temperatures ranging from ordinary temperature (about 5 to 20Â° c.) to about 150Â° c.
on the other hand, exhaust gases from road tunnels and the like are characterized in that they have a much lower no concentration of about 10 ppm or less as compared with the concentration of nitrogen oxides in exhaust gases from boilers and the like, their temperature is in the vicinity of ordinary temperature, and they are produced in enormous volumes. consequently, in order to remove denitrate gases from road tunnels and the like according to the conventional scr method, the temperature of the gases must be raised to 300Â° c. or above. this requires a huge amount of thermal energy and is unprofitable from an economical point of view.
in japanese patent publication no. 41142/'95, japanese patent provisional publication no. 47227/'95 and the like, there has been proposed a process in which low-concentration no at ordinary temperature is oxidized to no2 with ozone or the like, the resulting no2 is adsorbed to an adsorbent, and the highly concentrated no2 is decomposed by treatment with a reducing gas such as ammonia. however, in this process involving an adsorption step, not only the equipment is increased in size and becomes complicated, but also the use of ozone poses a new safety problem. this, it is difficult to put this process to practical use.
accordingly, a second object of the present invention is provide a technique by which no present in exhaust gases from road tunnels and the like and hence having a low concentration and a temperature in the vicinity of ordinary temperature can be directly reacted catalytically with ammonia and thereby decomposed to nitrogen and water.
now, an example of exhaust gas treatment by means of a conventional exhaust gas treating system is explained with reference to fig. 7.
in fig. 7, reference numeral 41 designates a boiler; 42, a denitrator; 43, an air preheater; 44, a dust collector; 45, a gas-gas heater; 46, a desulfurizer; and 47, a stack.
as shown in fig. 7, a denitrator 42 using a catalyst is installed at the outlet of a boiler 41 or the like in order to remove nitrogen oxides (nox) present in the exhaust gas, and an air preheater 43 is installed at the outlet of denitrator 42 in order to lower the temperature of the exhaust gas to about 130Â° c.
the exhaust gas having passed through the aforesaid air preheater 43 is dedusted in a dust collector 44, passed through a gas-gas heater 45 and then introduced into a desulfurizer 46 where sulfur oxides (sox) are removed therefrom. thereafter, the exhaust gas is discharged into the atmosphere through a stack 47.
as described above, in the current practical process for the removal of nitrogen oxides present in exhaust gas from boilers, there is used a denitrator 42 based on the selective catalytic reduction (scr) method in which nitrogen oxides are decomposed to nitrogen and water vapor by using a catalyst comprising v2o5 supported on tio2 and a reducing agent comprising nh3. however, this process involves the following problems.
first, a reaction temperature of 300 to 400Â° c. is required because of the performance of the catalyst. secondly, nh3 is required for use as reducing agent. thirdly, since the current leak level of nox is from 5 to 40 ppm, an excess of nh3 needs to be injected for the purpose of reducing the leak level of nox to zero.
moreover, recent environmental standards demand that the concentration of nitrogen oxides (nox) in exhaust gases should be reduced to a level of 1 ppm or less which is commonly known as a high-degree denitration level. in the aforesaid conventional denitration treatment based on the selective catalytic reduction (scr) method, a marked increase in removal cost due to an increased size of equipment and the like is unavoidable, even though the conditions are optimized. on the other hand, it is desired from the viewpoint of environmental problems to improve the efficiency of removal of nitrogen oxides.
accordingly, in view of the above-described problems, a third object of the present invention is to provide a denitration system which can achieve an improvement in the efficiency of removal of nitrogen oxides present in exhaust gases as compared with the prior art.
the present inventors have carried out investigations with a view to accomplishing the above-described first and second objects, and have now found that, when an active carbon having a large specific surface area and high porosity (in particular, one obtained by heat-treating active carbon fibers or a granular active carbon having a large number of fine micropores with a size of 20 Ã¥ or less under specific conditions) is used as a catalyst for the denitration reaction of exhaust gas, a high degree of denitration can be achieved even at low temperatures of 150Â° c. or below. moreover, they have also found that a high degree of denitration can be achieved even when exhaust gas having a low no concentration is treated in the vicinity of ordinary temperature.
that is, the present invention provides the following techniques concerning the denitration of exhaust gas. specifically, the present invention provides a process for producing an active carbon for use in the denitration of exhaust gas which comprises heat-treating a raw active carbon at 600 to 1,200Â° c. in a non-oxidizing atmosphere so as to remove oxygen-containing functional groups present at the surfaces thereof and thereby reduce the atomic surface oxygen/surface carbon ratio to 0.05 or less.
the present invention also provides a process for producing an active carbon for use in denitration which comprises heat-treating a raw active carbon at 600 to 1,200Â° c. in a non-oxidizing atmosphere and activating the surfaces thereof with sulfuric acid or nitric acid to impart oxidizing oxygen-containing functional groups thereto.
the present invention also provides a denitration method which comprises bringing exhaust gas containing nitrogen oxides and not more than 80% of water as water vapor, and nh3 gas having the same concentration as the nitrogen oxides into contact with an active carbon for use in the denitration of exhaust gas that is produced by any of the above-described processes, at a temperature ranging from ordinary temperature to 150Â° c., in order to reduce the nitrogen oxides selectively and thereby decompose them to nitrogen and water.
the present invention also provides the denitration method wherein a higher degree of denitration of nitrogen oxides having a temperature of 20 to 150Â° c. and a concentration of 5 to 400 ppm is performed at the outlet of an exhaust gas treating apparatus or the outlet of a boiler.
in order to accomplish the above-described third object, a first denitration system using active carbon in accordance with the present invention comprises a first packed reactor which is packed with a heat-treated active carbon produced by heat-treating a raw active carbon at a temperature in the range of 600 to 1,000Â° c., and a second packed reactor which is located downstream thereof and packed with the heat-treated active carbon, whereby exhaust gas and ammonia (nh3) are introduced into the first packed reactor so as to bring nitrogen oxides (nox) present in the exhaust gas into contact with the ammonia and remove the nitrogen oxides by the continuous selective reduction of them to nitrogen (n2), and any excess ammonia is recovered by adsorption in the second packed reactor.
in the aforesaid denitration system, a gas to be treated can be alternately introduced into the first packed reactor and the second packed reactor so as to perform denitration and ammonia adsorption repeatedly.
in order to accomplish the above-described third object, a second denitration system using active carbon in accordance with the present invention comprises a denitrator packed with a heat-treated active carbon which is produced by heat-treating a raw active carbon at a temperature in the range of 600 to 1,000Â° c., and first and second ammonia adsorbers located before and behind the denitrator, respectively, whereby exhaust gas containing nitrogen oxides is alternately introduced through any one of the first and second ammonia adsorbers, ammonia (nh3) is introduced at a position between the first or second ammonia adsorber and the denitrator, nitrogen oxides (nox) present in the exhaust gas are brought into contact with the heat-treated active carbon placed in the denitrator and removed by the continuous selective reduction of them to nitrogen (n2), and any excess ammonia is recovered by adsorption in the adsorber located downstream of the denitrator.
in the aforesaid denitration systems, the raw active carbon may comprise raw active carbon fibers or a raw granular active carbon. the raw active carbon fibers preferably comprise carbon fibers derived from polyacrylonitrile or pitch.
moreover, in the aforesaid denitration systems, there may be used an active carbon produced by subjecting the raw active carbon to a chemical treatment such as sulfuric acid treatment or metal carrying treatment, in place of the heat treatment.
the heat-treated active carbon of the present invention is highly effective as a catalyst for the denitration of exhaust gas. more specifically, when the heat-treated active carbon of the present invention is used for purposes of denitration, exhaust gases containing nitrogen oxides at low to high concentrations (about 20 to 500 ppm) can be denitrated at a low temperature ranging from ordinary temperature to about 150Â° c. and with a high degree of denitration of about 40 to 80%.
especially when active carbon fibers derived from pitch are used, excellent denitration performance can be achieved even under a high partial pressure of water vapor.
moreover, when the heat-treated active carbon of the present invention is used, gases containing nitrogen oxides at a low concentration of 15 ppm or less can be denitrated at a low temperature ranging from ordinary temperature to about 50Â° c. and with a high degree of denitration of about 40 to 80%, without oxidizing no to no2 by means of ozone, electron rays or the like, or without concentrating nitrogen oxides by means of an adsorbent. especially when active carbon fibers derived from pitch are used, excellent denitration performance can be achieved even under a high partial pressure of water vapor.
in the denitration systems of the present invention wherein the treatment of gases containing nitrogen oxides is performed by using an active carbon heat-treated under specific conditions as an ammonia adsorbent, low-concentration nitrogen oxides (nox) can be treated and, therefore, a higher degree of denitration can be achieved.",1,problem,removing nitrogen oxides (nox) present in exhaust gases,1.0,exact,0

this invention is especially suitable for the denitration of cold exhaust gases discharged from the outlets of existing exhaust gas denitration apparatus, boilers and the like.
moreover, this invention also relates to the removal of nitrogen oxides present in ventilation gases produced in road tunnels, underground parking spaces, street crossings and the like, and more particularly to a low-temperature denitration technique in which nitrogen oxides having a lower concentration (typically about 15 ppm or less) and a low temperature (typically ordinary temperature to about 50Â° c.) as compared with exhaust gases from boilers and the like can be efficiently reduced and thereby decomposed to nitrogen and water.
furthermore, this invention also relates to denitration systems using a heat-treated active carbon for the removal of nitrogen oxides (nox) present in exhaust gases discharged from boilers, gas turbines, engines and combustion furnaces for burning various types of fuel. the present invention can be suitably used for the removal of nitrogen oxides present in tunnels and for the removal of nitrogen oxides present in exhaust gases from nitric acid production plants.
for the denitration of exhaust gases from stationary nitrogen oxide-producing sources such as boilers, a method for reducing nitrogen oxides selectively by using vanadium oxide as a catalyst and ammonia as a reducing agent (i.e., the scr method) has conventionally been known and is widely employed for practical purposes (?œtechniques and regulations for the prevention of environmental pollution?? volume on the atmosphere, p. 130, maruzen co., ltd.). however, in this method using the vanadium oxide catalyst, the temperature of exhaust gas needs to be raised to 300Â° c. or above in order to achieve a practically sufficient degree of denitration. consequently, it is necessary to install a denitrator containing a catalyst bed in the high-temperature section of the boiler (e.g., just behind the outlet of the boiler or in the heat transfer section of the boiler), or reheat cold exhaust gas and thereby raise its temperature. however, these techniques involve the following problems.
when the denitrator is installed in the high-temperature section of the boiler, various problems arise in that the overall equipment becomes complicated, the use of a heat-resisting material causes an increase in equipment cost, and workability for replacement of the catalyst bed is reduced. when cold exhaust gas is reheated, an additional heater is required, resulting in an increase in equipment cost.
accordingly, a first object of the present invention is to provide a technique by which the denitration of exhaust gases from stationary nitrogen oxide-producing sources such as boilers can be performed at low temperatures ranging from ordinary temperature (about 5 to 20Â° c.) to about 150Â° c.
on the other hand, exhaust gases from road tunnels and the like are characterized in that they have a much lower no concentration of about 10 ppm or less as compared with the concentration of nitrogen oxides in exhaust gases from boilers and the like, their temperature is in the vicinity of ordinary temperature, and they are produced in enormous volumes. consequently, in order to remove denitrate gases from road tunnels and the like according to the conventional scr method, the temperature of the gases must be raised to 300Â° c. or above. this requires a huge amount of thermal energy and is unprofitable from an economical point of view.
in japanese patent publication no. 41142/'95, japanese patent provisional publication no. 47227/'95 and the like, there has been proposed a process in which low-concentration no at ordinary temperature is oxidized to no2 with ozone or the like, the resulting no2 is adsorbed to an adsorbent, and the highly concentrated no2 is decomposed by treatment with a reducing gas such as ammonia. however, in this process involving an adsorption step, not only the equipment is increased in size and becomes complicated, but also the use of ozone poses a new safety problem. this, it is difficult to put this process to practical use.
accordingly, a second object of the present invention is provide a technique by which no present in exhaust gases from road tunnels and the like and hence having a low concentration and a temperature in the vicinity of ordinary temperature can be directly reacted catalytically with ammonia and thereby decomposed to nitrogen and water.
now, an example of exhaust gas treatment by means of a conventional exhaust gas treating system is explained with reference to fig. 7.
in fig. 7, reference numeral 41 designates a boiler; 42, a denitrator; 43, an air preheater; 44, a dust collector; 45, a gas-gas heater; 46, a desulfurizer; and 47, a stack.
as shown in fig. 7, a denitrator 42 using a catalyst is installed at the outlet of a boiler 41 or the like in order to remove nitrogen oxides (nox) present in the exhaust gas, and an air preheater 43 is installed at the outlet of denitrator 42 in order to lower the temperature of the exhaust gas to about 130Â° c.
the exhaust gas having passed through the aforesaid air preheater 43 is dedusted in a dust collector 44, passed through a gas-gas heater 45 and then introduced into a desulfurizer 46 where sulfur oxides (sox) are removed therefrom. thereafter, the exhaust gas is discharged into the atmosphere through a stack 47.
as described above, in the current practical process for the removal of nitrogen oxides present in exhaust gas from boilers, there is used a denitrator 42 based on the selective catalytic reduction (scr) method in which nitrogen oxides are decomposed to nitrogen and water vapor by using a catalyst comprising v2o5 supported on tio2 and a reducing agent comprising nh3. however, this process involves the following problems.
first, a reaction temperature of 300 to 400Â° c. is required because of the performance of the catalyst. secondly, nh3 is required for use as reducing agent. thirdly, since the current leak level of nox is from 5 to 40 ppm, an excess of nh3 needs to be injected for the purpose of reducing the leak level of nox to zero.
moreover, recent environmental standards demand that the concentration of nitrogen oxides (nox) in exhaust gases should be reduced to a level of 1 ppm or less which is commonly known as a high-degree denitration level. in the aforesaid conventional denitration treatment based on the selective catalytic reduction (scr) method, a marked increase in removal cost due to an increased size of equipment and the like is unavoidable, even though the conditions are optimized. on the other hand, it is desired from the viewpoint of environmental problems to improve the efficiency of removal of nitrogen oxides.

furthermore, this invention also relates to denitration systems using a heat-treated active carbon for the removal of nitrogen oxides (nox) present in exhaust gases discharged from boilers, gas turbines, engines and combustion furnaces for burning various types of fuel. the present invention can be suitably used for the removal of nitrogen oxides present in tunnels and for the removal of nitrogen oxides present in exhaust gases from nitric acid production plants.
for the denitration of exhaust gases from stationary nitrogen oxide-producing sources such as boilers, a method for reducing nitrogen oxides selectively by using vanadium oxide as a catalyst and ammonia as a reducing agent (i.e., the scr method) has conventionally been known and is widely employed for practical purposes (?œtechniques and regulations for the prevention of environmental pollution?? volume on the atmosphere, p. 130, maruzen co., ltd.). however, in this method using the vanadium oxide catalyst, the temperature of exhaust gas needs to be raised to 300Â° c. or above in order to achieve a practically sufficient degree of denitration. consequently, it is necessary to install a denitrator containing a catalyst bed in the high-temperature section of the boiler (e.g., just behind the outlet of the boiler or in the heat transfer section of the boiler), or reheat cold exhaust gas and thereby raise its temperature. however, these techniques involve the following problems.
when the denitrator is installed in the high-temperature section of the boiler, various problems arise in that the overall equipment becomes complicated, the use of a heat-resisting material causes an increase in equipment cost, and workability for replacement of the catalyst bed is reduced. when cold exhaust gas is reheated, an additional heater is required, resulting in an increase in equipment cost.
accordingly, a first object of the present invention is to provide a technique by which the denitration of exhaust gases from stationary nitrogen oxide-producing sources such as boilers can be performed at low temperatures ranging from ordinary temperature (about 5 to 20Â° c.) to about 150Â° c.
on the other hand, exhaust gases from road tunnels and the like are characterized in that they have a much lower no concentration of about 10 ppm or less as compared with the concentration of nitrogen oxides in exhaust gases from boilers and the like, their temperature is in the vicinity of ordinary temperature, and they are produced in enormous volumes. consequently, in order to remove denitrate gases from road tunnels and the like according to the conventional scr method, the temperature of the gases must be raised to 300Â° c. or above. this requires a huge amount of thermal energy and is unprofitable from an economical point of view.
in japanese patent publication no. 41142/'95, japanese patent provisional publication no. 47227/'95 and the like, there has been proposed a process in which low-concentration no at ordinary temperature is oxidized to no2 with ozone or the like, the resulting no2 is adsorbed to an adsorbent, and the highly concentrated no2 is decomposed by treatment with a reducing gas such as ammonia. however, in this process involving an adsorption step, not only the equipment is increased in size and becomes complicated, but also the use of ozone poses a new safety problem. this, it is difficult to put this process to practical use.
accordingly, a second object of the present invention is provide a technique by which no present in exhaust gases from road tunnels and the like and hence having a low concentration and a temperature in the vicinity of ordinary temperature can be directly reacted catalytically with ammonia and thereby decomposed to nitrogen and water.
now, an example of exhaust gas treatment by means of a conventional exhaust gas treating system is explained with reference to fig. 7.
in fig. 7, reference numeral 41 designates a boiler; 42, a denitrator; 43, an air preheater; 44, a dust collector; 45, a gas-gas heater; 46, a desulfurizer; and 47, a stack.
as shown in fig. 7, a denitrator 42 using a catalyst is installed at the outlet of a boiler 41 or the like in order to remove nitrogen oxides (nox) present in the exhaust gas, and an air preheater 43 is installed at the outlet of denitrator 42 in order to lower the temperature of the exhaust gas to about 130Â° c.
the exhaust gas having passed through the aforesaid air preheater 43 is dedusted in a dust collector 44, passed through a gas-gas heater 45 and then introduced into a desulfurizer 46 where sulfur oxides (sox) are removed therefrom. thereafter, the exhaust gas is discharged into the atmosphere through a stack 47.
as described above, in the current practical process for the removal of nitrogen oxides present in exhaust gas from boilers, there is used a denitrator 42 based on the selective catalytic reduction (scr) method in which nitrogen oxides are decomposed to nitrogen and water vapor by using a catalyst comprising v2o5 supported on tio2 and a reducing agent comprising nh3. however, this process involves the following problems.
first, a reaction temperature of 300 to 400Â° c. is required because of the performance of the catalyst. secondly, nh3 is required for use as reducing agent. thirdly, since the current leak level of nox is from 5 to 40 ppm, an excess of nh3 needs to be injected for the purpose of reducing the leak level of nox to zero.
moreover, recent environmental standards demand that the concentration of nitrogen oxides (nox) in exhaust gases should be reduced to a level of 1 ppm or less which is commonly known as a high-degree denitration level. in the aforesaid conventional denitration treatment based on the selective catalytic reduction (scr) method, a marked increase in removal cost due to an increased size of equipment and the like is unavoidable, even though the conditions are optimized. on the other hand, it is desired from the viewpoint of environmental problems to improve the efficiency of removal of nitrogen oxides.
accordingly, in view of the above-described problems, a third object of the present invention is to provide a denitration system which can achieve an improvement in the efficiency of removal of nitrogen oxides present in exhaust gases as compared with the prior art.
the present inventors have carried out investigations with a view to accomplishing the above-described first and second objects, and have now found that, when an active carbon having a large specific surface area and high porosity (in particular, one obtained by heat-treating active carbon fibers or a granular active carbon having a large number of fine micropores with a size of 20 Ã¥ or less under specific conditions) is used as a catalyst for the denitration reaction of exhaust gas, a high degree of denitration can be achieved even at low temperatures of 150Â° c. or below. moreover, they have also found that a high degree of denitration can be achieved even when exhaust gas having a low no concentration is treated in the vicinity of ordinary temperature.
that is, the present invention provides the following techniques concerning the denitration of exhaust gas. specifically, the present invention provides a process for producing an active carbon for use in the denitration of exhaust gas which comprises heat-treating a raw active carbon at 600 to 1,200Â° c. in a non-oxidizing atmosphere so as to remove oxygen-containing functional groups present at the surfaces thereof and thereby reduce the atomic surface oxygen/surface carbon ratio to 0.05 or less.
the present invention also provides a process for producing an active carbon for use in denitration which comprises heat-treating a raw active carbon at 600 to 1,200Â° c. in a non-oxidizing atmosphere and activating the surfaces thereof with sulfuric acid or nitric acid to impart oxidizing oxygen-containing functional groups thereto.
the present invention also provides a denitration method which comprises bringing exhaust gas containing nitrogen oxides and not more than 80% of water as water vapor, and nh3 gas having the same concentration as the nitrogen oxides into contact with an active carbon for use in the denitration of exhaust gas that is produced by any of the above-described processes, at a temperature ranging from ordinary temperature to 150Â° c., in order to reduce the nitrogen oxides selectively and thereby decompose them to nitrogen and water.
the present invention also provides the denitration method wherein a higher degree of denitration of nitrogen oxides having a temperature of 20 to 150Â° c. and a concentration of 5 to 400 ppm is performed at the outlet of an exhaust gas treating apparatus or the outlet of a boiler.
in order to accomplish the above-described third object, a first denitration system using active carbon in accordance with the present invention comprises a first packed reactor which is packed with a heat-treated active carbon produced by heat-treating a raw active carbon at a temperature in the range of 600 to 1,000Â° c., and a second packed reactor which is located downstream thereof and packed with the heat-treated active carbon, whereby exhaust gas and ammonia (nh3) are introduced into the first packed reactor so as to bring nitrogen oxides (nox) present in the exhaust gas into contact with the ammonia and remove the nitrogen oxides by the continuous selective reduction of them to nitrogen (n2), and any excess ammonia is recovered by adsorption in the second packed reactor.
in the aforesaid denitration system, a gas to be treated can be alternately introduced into the first packed reactor and the second packed reactor so as to perform denitration and ammonia adsorption repeatedly.
in order to accomplish the above-described third object, a second denitration system using active carbon in accordance with the present invention comprises a denitrator packed with a heat-treated active carbon which is produced by heat-treating a raw active carbon at a temperature in the range of 600 to 1,000Â° c., and first and second ammonia adsorbers located before and behind the denitrator, respectively, whereby exhaust gas containing nitrogen oxides is alternately introduced through any one of the first and second ammonia adsorbers, ammonia (nh3) is introduced at a position between the first or second ammonia adsorber and the denitrator, nitrogen oxides (nox) present in the exhaust gas are brought into contact with the heat-treated active carbon placed in the denitrator and removed by the continuous selective reduction of them to nitrogen (n2), and any excess ammonia is recovered by adsorption in the adsorber located downstream of the denitrator.
in the aforesaid denitration systems, the raw active carbon may comprise raw active carbon fibers or a raw granular active carbon. the raw active carbon fibers preferably comprise carbon fibers derived from polyacrylonitrile or pitch.
moreover, in the aforesaid denitration systems, there may be used an active carbon produced by subjecting the raw active carbon to a chemical treatment such as sulfuric acid treatment or metal carrying treatment, in place of the heat treatment.
the heat-treated active carbon of the present invention is highly effective as a catalyst for the denitration of exhaust gas. more specifically, when the heat-treated active carbon of the present invention is used for purposes of denitration, exhaust gases containing nitrogen oxides at low to high concentrations (about 20 to 500 ppm) can be denitrated at a low temperature ranging from ordinary temperature to about 150Â° c. and with a high degree of denitration of about 40 to 80%.
especially when active carbon fibers derived from pitch are used, excellent denitration performance can be achieved even under a high partial pressure of water vapor.
moreover, when the heat-treated active carbon of the present invention is used, gases containing nitrogen oxides at a low concentration of 15 ppm or less can be denitrated at a low temperature ranging from ordinary temperature to about 50Â° c. and with a high degree of denitration of about 40 to 80%, without oxidizing no to no2 by means of ozone, electron rays or the like, or without concentrating nitrogen oxides by means of an adsorbent. especially when active carbon fibers derived from pitch are used, excellent denitration performance can be achieved even under a high partial pressure of water vapor.

first, a reaction temperature of 300 to 400Â° c. is required because of the performance of the catalyst. secondly, nh3 is required for use as reducing agent. thirdly, since the current leak level of nox is from 5 to 40 ppm, an excess of nh3 needs to be injected for the purpose of reducing the leak level of nox to zero.
moreover, recent environmental standards demand that the concentration of nitrogen oxides (nox) in exhaust gases should be reduced to a level of 1 ppm or less which is commonly known as a high-degree denitration level. in the aforesaid conventional denitration treatment based on the selective catalytic reduction (scr) method, a marked increase in removal cost due to an increased size of equipment and the like is unavoidable, even though the conditions are optimized. on the other hand, it is desired from the viewpoint of environmental problems to improve the efficiency of removal of nitrogen oxides.
accordingly, in view of the above-described problems, a third object of the present invention is to provide a denitration system which can achieve an improvement in the efficiency of removal of nitrogen oxides present in exhaust gases as compared with the prior art.
the present inventors have carried out investigations with a view to accomplishing the above-described first and second objects, and have now found that, when an active carbon having a large specific surface area and high porosity (in particular, one obtained by heat-treating active carbon fibers or a granular active carbon having a large number of fine micropores with a size of 20 Ã¥ or less under specific conditions) is used as a catalyst for the denitration reaction of exhaust gas, a high degree of denitration can be achieved even at low temperatures of 150Â° c. or below. moreover, they have also found that a high degree of denitration can be achieved even when exhaust gas having a low no concentration is treated in the vicinity of ordinary temperature.
that is, the present invention provides the following techniques concerning the denitration of exhaust gas. specifically, the present invention provides a process for producing an active carbon for use in the denitration of exhaust gas which comprises heat-treating a raw active carbon at 600 to 1,200Â° c. in a non-oxidizing atmosphere so as to remove oxygen-containing functional groups present at the surfaces thereof and thereby reduce the atomic surface oxygen/surface carbon ratio to 0.05 or less.
the present invention also provides a process for producing an active carbon for use in denitration which comprises heat-treating a raw active carbon at 600 to 1,200Â° c. in a non-oxidizing atmosphere and activating the surfaces thereof with sulfuric acid or nitric acid to impart oxidizing oxygen-containing functional groups thereto.
the present invention also provides a denitration method which comprises bringing exhaust gas containing nitrogen oxides and not more than 80% of water as water vapor, and nh3 gas having the same concentration as the nitrogen oxides into contact with an active carbon for use in the denitration of exhaust gas that is produced by any of the above-described processes, at a temperature ranging from ordinary temperature to 150Â° c., in order to reduce the nitrogen oxides selectively and thereby decompose them to nitrogen and water.
the present invention also provides the denitration method wherein a higher degree of denitration of nitrogen oxides having a temperature of 20 to 150Â° c. and a concentration of 5 to 400 ppm is performed at the outlet of an exhaust gas treating apparatus or the outlet of a boiler.
in order to accomplish the above-described third object, a first denitration system using active carbon in accordance with the present invention comprises a first packed reactor which is packed with a heat-treated active carbon produced by heat-treating a raw active carbon at a temperature in the range of 600 to 1,000Â° c., and a second packed reactor which is located downstream thereof and packed with the heat-treated active carbon, whereby exhaust gas and ammonia (nh3) are introduced into the first packed reactor so as to bring nitrogen oxides (nox) present in the exhaust gas into contact with the ammonia and remove the nitrogen oxides by the continuous selective reduction of them to nitrogen (n2), and any excess ammonia is recovered by adsorption in the second packed reactor.
in the aforesaid denitration system, a gas to be treated can be alternately introduced into the first packed reactor and the second packed reactor so as to perform denitration and ammonia adsorption repeatedly.
in order to accomplish the above-described third object, a second denitration system using active carbon in accordance with the present invention comprises a denitrator packed with a heat-treated active carbon which is produced by heat-treating a raw active carbon at a temperature in the range of 600 to 1,000Â° c., and first and second ammonia adsorbers located before and behind the denitrator, respectively, whereby exhaust gas containing nitrogen oxides is alternately introduced through any one of the first and second ammonia adsorbers, ammonia (nh3) is introduced at a position between the first or second ammonia adsorber and the denitrator, nitrogen oxides (nox) present in the exhaust gas are brought into contact with the heat-treated active carbon placed in the denitrator and removed by the continuous selective reduction of them to nitrogen (n2), and any excess ammonia is recovered by adsorption in the adsorber located downstream of the denitrator.
in the aforesaid denitration systems, the raw active carbon may comprise raw active carbon fibers or a raw granular active carbon. the raw active carbon fibers preferably comprise carbon fibers derived from polyacrylonitrile or pitch.
moreover, in the aforesaid denitration systems, there may be used an active carbon produced by subjecting the raw active carbon to a chemical treatment such as sulfuric acid treatment or metal carrying treatment, in place of the heat treatment.
the heat-treated active carbon of the present invention is highly effective as a catalyst for the denitration of exhaust gas. more specifically, when the heat-treated active carbon of the present invention is used for purposes of denitration, exhaust gases containing nitrogen oxides at low to high concentrations (about 20 to 500 ppm) can be denitrated at a low temperature ranging from ordinary temperature to about 150Â° c. and with a high degree of denitration of about 40 to 80%.
especially when active carbon fibers derived from pitch are used, excellent denitration performance can be achieved even under a high partial pressure of water vapor.
moreover, when the heat-treated active carbon of the present invention is used, gases containing nitrogen oxides at a low concentration of 15 ppm or less can be denitrated at a low temperature ranging from ordinary temperature to about 50Â° c. and with a high degree of denitration of about 40 to 80%, without oxidizing no to no2 by means of ozone, electron rays or the like, or without concentrating nitrogen oxides by means of an adsorbent. especially when active carbon fibers derived from pitch are used, excellent denitration performance can be achieved even under a high partial pressure of water vapor.
in the denitration systems of the present invention wherein the treatment of gases containing nitrogen oxides is performed by using an active carbon heat-treated under specific conditions as an ammonia adsorbent, low-concentration nitrogen oxides (nox) can be treated and, therefore, a higher degree of denitration can be achieved.",6,problem,increase in equipment cost,1.0,exact,-1

this invention is especially suitable for the denitration of cold exhaust gases discharged from the outlets of existing exhaust gas denitration apparatus, boilers and the like.
moreover, this invention also relates to the removal of nitrogen oxides present in ventilation gases produced in road tunnels, underground parking spaces, street crossings and the like, and more particularly to a low-temperature denitration technique in which nitrogen oxides having a lower concentration (typically about 15 ppm or less) and a low temperature (typically ordinary temperature to about 50Â° c.) as compared with exhaust gases from boilers and the like can be efficiently reduced and thereby decomposed to nitrogen and water.
furthermore, this invention also relates to denitration systems using a heat-treated active carbon for the removal of nitrogen oxides (nox) present in exhaust gases discharged from boilers, gas turbines, engines and combustion furnaces for burning various types of fuel. the present invention can be suitably used for the removal of nitrogen oxides present in tunnels and for the removal of nitrogen oxides present in exhaust gases from nitric acid production plants.
for the denitration of exhaust gases from stationary nitrogen oxide-producing sources such as boilers, a method for reducing nitrogen oxides selectively by using vanadium oxide as a catalyst and ammonia as a reducing agent (i.e., the scr method) has conventionally been known and is widely employed for practical purposes (?œtechniques and regulations for the prevention of environmental pollution?? volume on the atmosphere, p. 130, maruzen co., ltd.). however, in this method using the vanadium oxide catalyst, the temperature of exhaust gas needs to be raised to 300Â° c. or above in order to achieve a practically sufficient degree of denitration. consequently, it is necessary to install a denitrator containing a catalyst bed in the high-temperature section of the boiler (e.g., just behind the outlet of the boiler or in the heat transfer section of the boiler), or reheat cold exhaust gas and thereby raise its temperature. however, these techniques involve the following problems.
when the denitrator is installed in the high-temperature section of the boiler, various problems arise in that the overall equipment becomes complicated, the use of a heat-resisting material causes an increase in equipment cost, and workability for replacement of the catalyst bed is reduced. when cold exhaust gas is reheated, an additional heater is required, resulting in an increase in equipment cost.
accordingly, a first object of the present invention is to provide a technique by which the denitration of exhaust gases from stationary nitrogen oxide-producing sources such as boilers can be performed at low temperatures ranging from ordinary temperature (about 5 to 20Â° c.) to about 150Â° c.
on the other hand, exhaust gases from road tunnels and the like are characterized in that they have a much lower no concentration of about 10 ppm or less as compared with the concentration of nitrogen oxides in exhaust gases from boilers and the like, their temperature is in the vicinity of ordinary temperature, and they are produced in enormous volumes. consequently, in order to remove denitrate gases from road tunnels and the like according to the conventional scr method, the temperature of the gases must be raised to 300Â° c. or above. this requires a huge amount of thermal energy and is unprofitable from an economical point of view.
in japanese patent publication no. 41142/'95, japanese patent provisional publication no. 47227/'95 and the like, there has been proposed a process in which low-concentration no at ordinary temperature is oxidized to no2 with ozone or the like, the resulting no2 is adsorbed to an adsorbent, and the highly concentrated no2 is decomposed by treatment with a reducing gas such as ammonia. however, in this process involving an adsorption step, not only the equipment is increased in size and becomes complicated, but also the use of ozone poses a new safety problem. this, it is difficult to put this process to practical use.
accordingly, a second object of the present invention is provide a technique by which no present in exhaust gases from road tunnels and the like and hence having a low concentration and a temperature in the vicinity of ordinary temperature can be directly reacted catalytically with ammonia and thereby decomposed to nitrogen and water.
now, an example of exhaust gas treatment by means of a conventional exhaust gas treating system is explained with reference to fig. 7.

moreover, this invention also relates to the removal of nitrogen oxides present in ventilation gases produced in road tunnels, underground parking spaces, street crossings and the like, and more particularly to a low-temperature denitration technique in which nitrogen oxides having a lower concentration (typically about 15 ppm or less) and a low temperature (typically ordinary temperature to about 50Â° c.) as compared with exhaust gases from boilers and the like can be efficiently reduced and thereby decomposed to nitrogen and water.
furthermore, this invention also relates to denitration systems using a heat-treated active carbon for the removal of nitrogen oxides (nox) present in exhaust gases discharged from boilers, gas turbines, engines and combustion furnaces for burning various types of fuel. the present invention can be suitably used for the removal of nitrogen oxides present in tunnels and for the removal of nitrogen oxides present in exhaust gases from nitric acid production plants.
for the denitration of exhaust gases from stationary nitrogen oxide-producing sources such as boilers, a method for reducing nitrogen oxides selectively by using vanadium oxide as a catalyst and ammonia as a reducing agent (i.e., the scr method) has conventionally been known and is widely employed for practical purposes (?œtechniques and regulations for the prevention of environmental pollution?? volume on the atmosphere, p. 130, maruzen co., ltd.). however, in this method using the vanadium oxide catalyst, the temperature of exhaust gas needs to be raised to 300Â° c. or above in order to achieve a practically sufficient degree of denitration. consequently, it is necessary to install a denitrator containing a catalyst bed in the high-temperature section of the boiler (e.g., just behind the outlet of the boiler or in the heat transfer section of the boiler), or reheat cold exhaust gas and thereby raise its temperature. however, these techniques involve the following problems.
when the denitrator is installed in the high-temperature section of the boiler, various problems arise in that the overall equipment becomes complicated, the use of a heat-resisting material causes an increase in equipment cost, and workability for replacement of the catalyst bed is reduced. when cold exhaust gas is reheated, an additional heater is required, resulting in an increase in equipment cost.
accordingly, a first object of the present invention is to provide a technique by which the denitration of exhaust gases from stationary nitrogen oxide-producing sources such as boilers can be performed at low temperatures ranging from ordinary temperature (about 5 to 20Â° c.) to about 150Â° c.
on the other hand, exhaust gases from road tunnels and the like are characterized in that they have a much lower no concentration of about 10 ppm or less as compared with the concentration of nitrogen oxides in exhaust gases from boilers and the like, their temperature is in the vicinity of ordinary temperature, and they are produced in enormous volumes. consequently, in order to remove denitrate gases from road tunnels and the like according to the conventional scr method, the temperature of the gases must be raised to 300Â° c. or above. this requires a huge amount of thermal energy and is unprofitable from an economical point of view.
in japanese patent publication no. 41142/'95, japanese patent provisional publication no. 47227/'95 and the like, there has been proposed a process in which low-concentration no at ordinary temperature is oxidized to no2 with ozone or the like, the resulting no2 is adsorbed to an adsorbent, and the highly concentrated no2 is decomposed by treatment with a reducing gas such as ammonia. however, in this process involving an adsorption step, not only the equipment is increased in size and becomes complicated, but also the use of ozone poses a new safety problem. this, it is difficult to put this process to practical use.
accordingly, a second object of the present invention is provide a technique by which no present in exhaust gases from road tunnels and the like and hence having a low concentration and a temperature in the vicinity of ordinary temperature can be directly reacted catalytically with ammonia and thereby decomposed to nitrogen and water.
now, an example of exhaust gas treatment by means of a conventional exhaust gas treating system is explained with reference to fig. 7.
in fig. 7, reference numeral 41 designates a boiler; 42, a denitrator; 43, an air preheater; 44, a dust collector; 45, a gas-gas heater; 46, a desulfurizer; and 47, a stack.
as shown in fig. 7, a denitrator 42 using a catalyst is installed at the outlet of a boiler 41 or the like in order to remove nitrogen oxides (nox) present in the exhaust gas, and an air preheater 43 is installed at the outlet of denitrator 42 in order to lower the temperature of the exhaust gas to about 130Â° c.
the exhaust gas having passed through the aforesaid air preheater 43 is dedusted in a dust collector 44, passed through a gas-gas heater 45 and then introduced into a desulfurizer 46 where sulfur oxides (sox) are removed therefrom. thereafter, the exhaust gas is discharged into the atmosphere through a stack 47.
as described above, in the current practical process for the removal of nitrogen oxides present in exhaust gas from boilers, there is used a denitrator 42 based on the selective catalytic reduction (scr) method in which nitrogen oxides are decomposed to nitrogen and water vapor by using a catalyst comprising v2o5 supported on tio2 and a reducing agent comprising nh3. however, this process involves the following problems.
first, a reaction temperature of 300 to 400Â° c. is required because of the performance of the catalyst. secondly, nh3 is required for use as reducing agent. thirdly, since the current leak level of nox is from 5 to 40 ppm, an excess of nh3 needs to be injected for the purpose of reducing the leak level of nox to zero.
moreover, recent environmental standards demand that the concentration of nitrogen oxides (nox) in exhaust gases should be reduced to a level of 1 ppm or less which is commonly known as a high-degree denitration level. in the aforesaid conventional denitration treatment based on the selective catalytic reduction (scr) method, a marked increase in removal cost due to an increased size of equipment and the like is unavoidable, even though the conditions are optimized. on the other hand, it is desired from the viewpoint of environmental problems to improve the efficiency of removal of nitrogen oxides.
accordingly, in view of the above-described problems, a third object of the present invention is to provide a denitration system which can achieve an improvement in the efficiency of removal of nitrogen oxides present in exhaust gases as compared with the prior art.
the present inventors have carried out investigations with a view to accomplishing the above-described first and second objects, and have now found that, when an active carbon having a large specific surface area and high porosity (in particular, one obtained by heat-treating active carbon fibers or a granular active carbon having a large number of fine micropores with a size of 20 Ã¥ or less under specific conditions) is used as a catalyst for the denitration reaction of exhaust gas, a high degree of denitration can be achieved even at low temperatures of 150Â° c. or below. moreover, they have also found that a high degree of denitration can be achieved even when exhaust gas having a low no concentration is treated in the vicinity of ordinary temperature.
that is, the present invention provides the following techniques concerning the denitration of exhaust gas. specifically, the present invention provides a process for producing an active carbon for use in the denitration of exhaust gas which comprises heat-treating a raw active carbon at 600 to 1,200Â° c. in a non-oxidizing atmosphere so as to remove oxygen-containing functional groups present at the surfaces thereof and thereby reduce the atomic surface oxygen/surface carbon ratio to 0.05 or less.
the present invention also provides a process for producing an active carbon for use in denitration which comprises heat-treating a raw active carbon at 600 to 1,200Â° c. in a non-oxidizing atmosphere and activating the surfaces thereof with sulfuric acid or nitric acid to impart oxidizing oxygen-containing functional groups thereto.
the present invention also provides a denitration method which comprises bringing exhaust gas containing nitrogen oxides and not more than 80% of water as water vapor, and nh3 gas having the same concentration as the nitrogen oxides into contact with an active carbon for use in the denitration of exhaust gas that is produced by any of the above-described processes, at a temperature ranging from ordinary temperature to 150Â° c., in order to reduce the nitrogen oxides selectively and thereby decompose them to nitrogen and water.
the present invention also provides the denitration method wherein a higher degree of denitration of nitrogen oxides having a temperature of 20 to 150Â° c. and a concentration of 5 to 400 ppm is performed at the outlet of an exhaust gas treating apparatus or the outlet of a boiler.
in order to accomplish the above-described third object, a first denitration system using active carbon in accordance with the present invention comprises a first packed reactor which is packed with a heat-treated active carbon produced by heat-treating a raw active carbon at a temperature in the range of 600 to 1,000Â° c., and a second packed reactor which is located downstream thereof and packed with the heat-treated active carbon, whereby exhaust gas and ammonia (nh3) are introduced into the first packed reactor so as to bring nitrogen oxides (nox) present in the exhaust gas into contact with the ammonia and remove the nitrogen oxides by the continuous selective reduction of them to nitrogen (n2), and any excess ammonia is recovered by adsorption in the second packed reactor.
in the aforesaid denitration system, a gas to be treated can be alternately introduced into the first packed reactor and the second packed reactor so as to perform denitration and ammonia adsorption repeatedly.
in order to accomplish the above-described third object, a second denitration system using active carbon in accordance with the present invention comprises a denitrator packed with a heat-treated active carbon which is produced by heat-treating a raw active carbon at a temperature in the range of 600 to 1,000Â° c., and first and second ammonia adsorbers located before and behind the denitrator, respectively, whereby exhaust gas containing nitrogen oxides is alternately introduced through any one of the first and second ammonia adsorbers, ammonia (nh3) is introduced at a position between the first or second ammonia adsorber and the denitrator, nitrogen oxides (nox) present in the exhaust gas are brought into contact with the heat-treated active carbon placed in the denitrator and removed by the continuous selective reduction of them to nitrogen (n2), and any excess ammonia is recovered by adsorption in the adsorber located downstream of the denitrator.
in the aforesaid denitration systems, the raw active carbon may comprise raw active carbon fibers or a raw granular active carbon. the raw active carbon fibers preferably comprise carbon fibers derived from polyacrylonitrile or pitch.
moreover, in the aforesaid denitration systems, there may be used an active carbon produced by subjecting the raw active carbon to a chemical treatment such as sulfuric acid treatment or metal carrying treatment, in place of the heat treatment.
the heat-treated active carbon of the present invention is highly effective as a catalyst for the denitration of exhaust gas. more specifically, when the heat-treated active carbon of the present invention is used for purposes of denitration, exhaust gases containing nitrogen oxides at low to high concentrations (about 20 to 500 ppm) can be denitrated at a low temperature ranging from ordinary temperature to about 150Â° c. and with a high degree of denitration of about 40 to 80%.
especially when active carbon fibers derived from pitch are used, excellent denitration performance can be achieved even under a high partial pressure of water vapor.
moreover, when the heat-treated active carbon of the present invention is used, gases containing nitrogen oxides at a low concentration of 15 ppm or less can be denitrated at a low temperature ranging from ordinary temperature to about 50Â° c. and with a high degree of denitration of about 40 to 80%, without oxidizing no to no2 by means of ozone, electron rays or the like, or without concentrating nitrogen oxides by means of an adsorbent. especially when active carbon fibers derived from pitch are used, excellent denitration performance can be achieved even under a high partial pressure of water vapor.

the invention relates to a process for removing so2, hcn and h2s and optionally cos, cs2 and nh3 from a gas stream.
gas streams from industrial chemical processes may contain a variety of sulphur compounds such as h2s, so2, cs2 and cos. the removal of these sulphur compounds is of considerable importance, because the toxicity and smell of sulphur compounds renders their presence highly undesirable. in addition, other compounds whose presence is undesirable may be present such as hcn or nh3. it is often necessary for the intended purposes of the gas stream to remove these compounds at least partly, for example to prevent catalyst poisoning in processes after the gasification stage.
processes for the removal of sulphur compounds are known in the art.
in ep 324,526 a process is described for the removal of h2s, cos, cs2 and so2 from a gas stream, by converting cos and cs2 into h2s. although ep 324,526 mentions the removal of h2s, it does not specify the preferred type of process for h2s removal, nor is the concentration of h2s in the treated gas stream mentioned.
a process known in the art for the removal of h2s from a gas stream is the partial oxidation of h2s to so2 according to:

partial h2s oxidation 2h2s+3o2??h2o+2so2 ?ƒâ€?1)

the so2 formed can be (catalytically) converted to elemental sulphur according to the claus reaction:

claus reaction 4h2s+2so2??h2o+3s2 ?ƒâ€?2)

this process is known as the claus process. the claus process is frequently employed both in refineries and for the processing of h2s recovered from natural gas.

a disadvantage of the claus process is that it is thermodynamically limited by the increase of the water vapour content and simultaneously by the decrease of the h2s and so2 concentration as the h2s conversion proceeds, with the result that the equilibrium of the claus reaction shifts to the left. since the dew point of water lies below the solidification point of sulphur, condensation of the water vapour in the process gas to remove this limitation can lead to serious problems, such as clogging due to the solidification of sulphur and corrosion due to the formation of sulfuric acid, causing serious operational problems.
at relatively low concentrations of h2s, typically concentrations below 20 vol %, the claus process is difficult to operate and requires special technical provisions.
another disadvantage of the claus process is that the concentration of h2s in the treated gas is still relatively high. the claus process has been improved to an extent where the h2s content of the treated gas can be. lowered to approximately 1 vol % (superclaus-99 process) and the so2 content to approximately 0.02 vol %. however, especially in the case where it is necessary to comply with requirements with regard to residential use or environmental regulations with respect to emission of sulphur compounds, even lower concentrations of h2s and so2, in the ppm range, have to be achieved. a disadvantage of the claus and superclaus process is that such low concentrations of h2s and so2cannot be achieved.
the removal of hcn from gas streams is important not only because of its own toxic properties, but also in view of corrosive nox compounds which can evolve when both hcn and oxygen are present in a gas stream. in addition, hcn itself is corrosive to equipment when allowed to concentrate in liquid streams upon gas treating.
we have now found a relatively simple and inexpensive process for removing so2, h2s and hcn and optionally cos, cs2 and nh3 from a gas stream. in the process according to the invention, a combination of reaction steps is used to achieve the removal of sulphur compounds such as h2s and so2, and optionally also cos and/or cs2, as well as hcn from a gas stream comprising these compounds, to concentrations of below 10 ppmv for h2s, below 100 ppmv for so2 and below 0.01 vol %, preferably 10 ppmv for hcn.
the invention relates to a process for the removal of so2, hcn and h2s and optionally one or more compounds from the group of cos, cs2 and nh3 from a first gas stream, which process comprises the steps of:

    (a) removing so2 from the first gas stream by contacting the first gas stream in a hydrogenation zone with a hydrogenation catalyst in the presence of hydrogen to obtain a second gas stream;
    (b) removing hcn and optionally cos and/or cs2 from the second gas stream obtained in step (a) by contacting the second gas stream in a hydrolysis zone with a hydrolysis catalyst in the presence of water to obtain a third gas stream;
    (c) removing nh3 from the third gas stream by contacting the third gas stream in a nh3-removal zone with an aqueous (acidic) washing liquid to obtain an ammonium-comprising aqueous stream and a fourth gas stream;
    (d) removing h2s from the fourth gas stream by contacting the fourth gas stream in a h2s-removal zone with an aqueous alkaline washing liquid to obtain a h2s-depleted gas stream and a hydrogen-sulphide-comprising aqueous stream;
    (e) contacting the hydrogen-sulphide-comprising aqueous stream obtained in step (d) with sulphide-oxidizing bacteria in the presence of oxygen in a oxidation reactor to obtain a sulphur slurry and a regenerated aqueous alkaline washing liquid;

the invention relates to a process for removing so2, hcn and h2s and optionally cos, cs2 and nh3 from a gas stream.
gas streams from industrial chemical processes may contain a variety of sulphur compounds such as h2s, so2, cs2 and cos. the removal of these sulphur compounds is of considerable importance, because the toxicity and smell of sulphur compounds renders their presence highly undesirable. in addition, other compounds whose presence is undesirable may be present such as hcn or nh3. it is often necessary for the intended purposes of the gas stream to remove these compounds at least partly, for example to prevent catalyst poisoning in processes after the gasification stage.
processes for the removal of sulphur compounds are known in the art.
in ep 324,526 a process is described for the removal of h2s, cos, cs2 and so2 from a gas stream, by converting cos and cs2 into h2s. although ep 324,526 mentions the removal of h2s, it does not specify the preferred type of process for h2s removal, nor is the concentration of h2s in the treated gas stream mentioned.
a process known in the art for the removal of h2s from a gas stream is the partial oxidation of h2s to so2 according to:

partial h2s oxidation 2h2s+3o2??h2o+2so2 ?ƒâ€?1)

the so2 formed can be (catalytically) converted to elemental sulphur according to the claus reaction:

claus reaction 4h2s+2so2??h2o+3s2 ?ƒâ€?2)

this process is known as the claus process. the claus process is frequently employed both in refineries and for the processing of h2s recovered from natural gas.

a disadvantage of the claus process is that it is thermodynamically limited by the increase of the water vapour content and simultaneously by the decrease of the h2s and so2 concentration as the h2s conversion proceeds, with the result that the equilibrium of the claus reaction shifts to the left. since the dew point of water lies below the solidification point of sulphur, condensation of the water vapour in the process gas to remove this limitation can lead to serious problems, such as clogging due to the solidification of sulphur and corrosion due to the formation of sulfuric acid, causing serious operational problems.
at relatively low concentrations of h2s, typically concentrations below 20 vol %, the claus process is difficult to operate and requires special technical provisions.
another disadvantage of the claus process is that the concentration of h2s in the treated gas is still relatively high. the claus process has been improved to an extent where the h2s content of the treated gas can be. lowered to approximately 1 vol % (superclaus-99 process) and the so2 content to approximately 0.02 vol %. however, especially in the case where it is necessary to comply with requirements with regard to residential use or environmental regulations with respect to emission of sulphur compounds, even lower concentrations of h2s and so2, in the ppm range, have to be achieved. a disadvantage of the claus and superclaus process is that such low concentrations of h2s and so2cannot be achieved.
the removal of hcn from gas streams is important not only because of its own toxic properties, but also in view of corrosive nox compounds which can evolve when both hcn and oxygen are present in a gas stream. in addition, hcn itself is corrosive to equipment when allowed to concentrate in liquid streams upon gas treating.
we have now found a relatively simple and inexpensive process for removing so2, h2s and hcn and optionally cos, cs2 and nh3 from a gas stream. in the process according to the invention, a combination of reaction steps is used to achieve the removal of sulphur compounds such as h2s and so2, and optionally also cos and/or cs2, as well as hcn from a gas stream comprising these compounds, to concentrations of below 10 ppmv for h2s, below 100 ppmv for so2 and below 0.01 vol %, preferably 10 ppmv for hcn.
the invention relates to a process for the removal of so2, hcn and h2s and optionally one or more compounds from the group of cos, cs2 and nh3 from a first gas stream, which process comprises the steps of:

    (a) removing so2 from the first gas stream by contacting the first gas stream in a hydrogenation zone with a hydrogenation catalyst in the presence of hydrogen to obtain a second gas stream;

another disadvantage of the claus process is that the concentration of h2s in the treated gas is still relatively high. the claus process has been improved to an extent where the h2s content of the treated gas can be. lowered to approximately 1 vol % (superclaus-99 process) and the so2 content to approximately 0.02 vol %. however, especially in the case where it is necessary to comply with requirements with regard to residential use or environmental regulations with respect to emission of sulphur compounds, even lower concentrations of h2s and so2, in the ppm range, have to be achieved. a disadvantage of the claus and superclaus process is that such low concentrations of h2s and so2cannot be achieved.
the removal of hcn from gas streams is important not only because of its own toxic properties, but also in view of corrosive nox compounds which can evolve when both hcn and oxygen are present in a gas stream. in addition, hcn itself is corrosive to equipment when allowed to concentrate in liquid streams upon gas treating.
we have now found a relatively simple and inexpensive process for removing so2, h2s and hcn and optionally cos, cs2 and nh3 from a gas stream. in the process according to the invention, a combination of reaction steps is used to achieve the removal of sulphur compounds such as h2s and so2, and optionally also cos and/or cs2, as well as hcn from a gas stream comprising these compounds, to concentrations of below 10 ppmv for h2s, below 100 ppmv for so2 and below 0.01 vol %, preferably 10 ppmv for hcn.
the invention relates to a process for the removal of so2, hcn and h2s and optionally one or more compounds from the group of cos, cs2 and nh3 from a first gas stream, which process comprises the steps of:

    (a) removing so2 from the first gas stream by contacting the first gas stream in a hydrogenation zone with a hydrogenation catalyst in the presence of hydrogen to obtain a second gas stream;
    (b) removing hcn and optionally cos and/or cs2 from the second gas stream obtained in step (a) by contacting the second gas stream in a hydrolysis zone with a hydrolysis catalyst in the presence of water to obtain a third gas stream;

the invention relates to a process for removing so2, hcn and h2s and optionally cos, cs2 and nh3 from a gas stream.
gas streams from industrial chemical processes may contain a variety of sulphur compounds such as h2s, so2, cs2 and cos. the removal of these sulphur compounds is of considerable importance, because the toxicity and smell of sulphur compounds renders their presence highly undesirable. in addition, other compounds whose presence is undesirable may be present such as hcn or nh3. it is often necessary for the intended purposes of the gas stream to remove these compounds at least partly, for example to prevent catalyst poisoning in processes after the gasification stage.
processes for the removal of sulphur compounds are known in the art.
in ep 324,526 a process is described for the removal of h2s, cos, cs2 and so2 from a gas stream, by converting cos and cs2 into h2s. although ep 324,526 mentions the removal of h2s, it does not specify the preferred type of process for h2s removal, nor is the concentration of h2s in the treated gas stream mentioned.
a process known in the art for the removal of h2s from a gas stream is the partial oxidation of h2s to so2 according to:

the invention relates to the field of particle filters particularly used in an exhaust line of an engine for the elimination of soot produced by the combustion of a diesel fuel in an internal combustion engine.
the filtration structures for the soot contained in internal combustion engine exhaust gases are well known in the prior art. these structures most frequently have a honeycomb structure, one of the faces of the structure allowing the intake of the exhaust gases to be filtered and the other face the discharge of the filtered exhaust gases. the structure comprises, between the intake and discharge faces, a set of adjacent ducts or channels with axes parallel with one another separated by porous filtration walls, said ducts being stopped at one or other of their ends in order to delimit the inlet chambers opening on the intake face and the outlet chambers opening on the discharge face. for a good seal, the peripheral portion of the structure is most frequently surrounded by a coating cement. the channels or ducts are alternately stopped in an order such that the exhaust gases, as they pass through the honeycomb body, are forced to pass through the side walls of the inlet channels to join the outlet channels. in this manner, the particles or soot are deposited and accumulate on the porous walls of the filtering body. most frequently, the filtering bodies used in motor vehicle exhaust lines are made of porous ceramic material, for example of cordierite or of silicon carbide.
in a known manner, during its use, the particle filter is subjected to a succession of filtration phases (accumulation of soot) and of regeneration (elimination of soot). during the filtration phases, the soot particles emitted by the engine are retained and deposited inside the filter. during the regeneration phases, the soot particles are burned inside the filter, in order to restore thereto its filtration properties. the porous structure is then subjected to intense thermo-mechanical stresses, which may cause micro-cracks that are likely over time to cause a severe loss of the filtration capabilities of the unit, and even its complete deactivation. this phenomenon is particularly observed on large diameter monolithic filters. specifically, in the operation of an exhaust line, it has been observed that the temperature gradient between the center and the periphery of such structures increases as the dimensions of the monolith increase.
to solve these problems and increase the service life of the filters, filtration structures have more recently been proposed combining several monolithic honeycomb blocks or elements. the elements are most frequently assembled together by bonding by means of an adhesive or a cement of a ceramic nature, called in the rest of the description a joint cement. examples of such filtering structures are for example described in patent applications ep 816 065, ep 1 142 619, ep 1 455 923, wo 2004/090294 or else wo 2005/063462. in order to provide a better relaxation of the stresses in an assembled structure, it is known that the heat expansion coefficients of the various portions of the structure (filtration elements, coating cement, joint cement) must be substantially of the same order. consequently, said portions are advantageously synthesized based on one and the same material, most frequently silicon carbide sic or cordierite. this choice also makes it possible to even out the heat distribution during the regeneration of the filter.
to increase the filtration surface of said filter, at a constant filter volume, filtering elements whose shape and internal volume of the inlet and outlet channels are different have been proposed, for example in patent application wo 05/016491. in such structures, the wall elements succeed one another, in cross section and along a horizontal and/or vertical row of channels, to define a sinusoidal or wavy shape. the wall elements undulate typically by a half sine wave period over the width of a channel.
to improve the thermomechanical strength of the elements having such a wavy shape of the channels and consequently of the filter assembled from said elements having this particular channel shape, a honeycomb structure has been proposed in wo 05/063462 whose ratio r, characterizing two adjacent peripheral channels, between the average thickness ?œe??of the set of outer walls and the average thickness ?œe??of the set of inner walls of said channels, is greater than 1.2. it is indicated in this application that such a configuration makes it possible to reduce the risk of cracks that may appear particularly when local high amplitude stresses are generated during the regeneration phases, particularly due to high temperature gradients existing within the filter and the different types of materials used for the monolithic elements and the joint cement.
although such an increased thickness of the walls indeed makes it possible to significantly improve the thermomechanical strength of the filters assembled from such elements, it nevertheless also causes a not insignificant weight increase of the filters, typically of the order of 5.5 to 7.5%.
this weight increase has the disadvantage of increasing the thermal inertia of the filter, which causes an excess consumption during the regeneration phases and, when the filter incorporates a catalytic component, impairs its catalytic efficiency due to the increased activation (or energizing) time of the catalyzer.
the essential object of the present invention is to provide elements for the formation of a filter retaining the good thermomechanical properties of the previously described filters with reinforced wall, but whose total weight is substantially reduced.
more precisely, the invention relates to a monolithic honeycomb element comprising a set of adjacent ducts or channels with axes parallel with one another separated by porous walls, said ducts being stopped by plugs at one or other of their ends to delimit inlet ducts opening on a gas intake face and outlet ducts opening on a gas discharge face, so that the gas passes through the porous walls, wherein the peripheral channels forming part of the outer wall of said element are configured to help in the formation of an outer wall whose inner face is substantially flat over the whole length of the element and wherein said flat wall also has an increased thickness at the corners, so that, on a cross section, the ratio r of the thickness ec of the wall, measured along the bisecting line of the angle at a corner of the element, over the minimal thickness emin of said wall is greater than 1.5, and preferably greater than 1.6, or even 1.7.
preferably, the monolithic element has, in cross section, a periodic undulation of the walls of the inner channels making it possible to increase the overall volume of said inlet channels at the expense of the outlet channels.
usually the thickness emin of said outer wall is measured in the middle of a side of the element.
according to a possible embodiment of the invention, said increased thickness extends, from each corner of the element, over a portion of the outer walls and said increased thickness is continuous and constant over said portion.
according to an alternative embodiment, said increased thickness extends, from each corner of the element, over a portion of the outer walls and said increased thickness is continuous and decreasing over said portion.
advantageously, according to the invention, said increased thickness extends, from each corner of the element, over a total surface area equal to at least one eighth and preferably equal to at least one quarter of the total surface area of the inner faces of the outer walls.
according to the invention, the ratio of the thickness ec of the outer wall, measured along the bisecting line of the angle at a corner of the element, over the average thickness e of the inner walls of the channels is for example greater than 2.7, preferably greater than 3.5.

the filtration structures for the soot contained in internal combustion engine exhaust gases are well known in the prior art. these structures most frequently have a honeycomb structure, one of the faces of the structure allowing the intake of the exhaust gases to be filtered and the other face the discharge of the filtered exhaust gases. the structure comprises, between the intake and discharge faces, a set of adjacent ducts or channels with axes parallel with one another separated by porous filtration walls, said ducts being stopped at one or other of their ends in order to delimit the inlet chambers opening on the intake face and the outlet chambers opening on the discharge face. for a good seal, the peripheral portion of the structure is most frequently surrounded by a coating cement. the channels or ducts are alternately stopped in an order such that the exhaust gases, as they pass through the honeycomb body, are forced to pass through the side walls of the inlet channels to join the outlet channels. in this manner, the particles or soot are deposited and accumulate on the porous walls of the filtering body. most frequently, the filtering bodies used in motor vehicle exhaust lines are made of porous ceramic material, for example of cordierite or of silicon carbide.
in a known manner, during its use, the particle filter is subjected to a succession of filtration phases (accumulation of soot) and of regeneration (elimination of soot). during the filtration phases, the soot particles emitted by the engine are retained and deposited inside the filter. during the regeneration phases, the soot particles are burned inside the filter, in order to restore thereto its filtration properties. the porous structure is then subjected to intense thermo-mechanical stresses, which may cause micro-cracks that are likely over time to cause a severe loss of the filtration capabilities of the unit, and even its complete deactivation. this phenomenon is particularly observed on large diameter monolithic filters. specifically, in the operation of an exhaust line, it has been observed that the temperature gradient between the center and the periphery of such structures increases as the dimensions of the monolith increase.
to solve these problems and increase the service life of the filters, filtration structures have more recently been proposed combining several monolithic honeycomb blocks or elements. the elements are most frequently assembled together by bonding by means of an adhesive or a cement of a ceramic nature, called in the rest of the description a joint cement. examples of such filtering structures are for example described in patent applications ep 816 065, ep 1 142 619, ep 1 455 923, wo 2004/090294 or else wo 2005/063462. in order to provide a better relaxation of the stresses in an assembled structure, it is known that the heat expansion coefficients of the various portions of the structure (filtration elements, coating cement, joint cement) must be substantially of the same order. consequently, said portions are advantageously synthesized based on one and the same material, most frequently silicon carbide sic or cordierite. this choice also makes it possible to even out the heat distribution during the regeneration of the filter.
to increase the filtration surface of said filter, at a constant filter volume, filtering elements whose shape and internal volume of the inlet and outlet channels are different have been proposed, for example in patent application wo 05/016491. in such structures, the wall elements succeed one another, in cross section and along a horizontal and/or vertical row of channels, to define a sinusoidal or wavy shape. the wall elements undulate typically by a half sine wave period over the width of a channel.
to improve the thermomechanical strength of the elements having such a wavy shape of the channels and consequently of the filter assembled from said elements having this particular channel shape, a honeycomb structure has been proposed in wo 05/063462 whose ratio r, characterizing two adjacent peripheral channels, between the average thickness ?œe??of the set of outer walls and the average thickness ?œe??of the set of inner walls of said channels, is greater than 1.2. it is indicated in this application that such a configuration makes it possible to reduce the risk of cracks that may appear particularly when local high amplitude stresses are generated during the regeneration phases, particularly due to high temperature gradients existing within the filter and the different types of materials used for the monolithic elements and the joint cement.
although such an increased thickness of the walls indeed makes it possible to significantly improve the thermomechanical strength of the filters assembled from such elements, it nevertheless also causes a not insignificant weight increase of the filters, typically of the order of 5.5 to 7.5%.
this weight increase has the disadvantage of increasing the thermal inertia of the filter, which causes an excess consumption during the regeneration phases and, when the filter incorporates a catalytic component, impairs its catalytic efficiency due to the increased activation (or energizing) time of the catalyzer.
the essential object of the present invention is to provide elements for the formation of a filter retaining the good thermomechanical properties of the previously described filters with reinforced wall, but whose total weight is substantially reduced.
more precisely, the invention relates to a monolithic honeycomb element comprising a set of adjacent ducts or channels with axes parallel with one another separated by porous walls, said ducts being stopped by plugs at one or other of their ends to delimit inlet ducts opening on a gas intake face and outlet ducts opening on a gas discharge face, so that the gas passes through the porous walls, wherein the peripheral channels forming part of the outer wall of said element are configured to help in the formation of an outer wall whose inner face is substantially flat over the whole length of the element and wherein said flat wall also has an increased thickness at the corners, so that, on a cross section, the ratio r of the thickness ec of the wall, measured along the bisecting line of the angle at a corner of the element, over the minimal thickness emin of said wall is greater than 1.5, and preferably greater than 1.6, or even 1.7.

the invention relates to the field of particle filters particularly used in an exhaust line of an engine for the elimination of soot produced by the combustion of a diesel fuel in an internal combustion engine.
the filtration structures for the soot contained in internal combustion engine exhaust gases are well known in the prior art. these structures most frequently have a honeycomb structure, one of the faces of the structure allowing the intake of the exhaust gases to be filtered and the other face the discharge of the filtered exhaust gases. the structure comprises, between the intake and discharge faces, a set of adjacent ducts or channels with axes parallel with one another separated by porous filtration walls, said ducts being stopped at one or other of their ends in order to delimit the inlet chambers opening on the intake face and the outlet chambers opening on the discharge face. for a good seal, the peripheral portion of the structure is most frequently surrounded by a coating cement. the channels or ducts are alternately stopped in an order such that the exhaust gases, as they pass through the honeycomb body, are forced to pass through the side walls of the inlet channels to join the outlet channels. in this manner, the particles or soot are deposited and accumulate on the porous walls of the filtering body. most frequently, the filtering bodies used in motor vehicle exhaust lines are made of porous ceramic material, for example of cordierite or of silicon carbide.
in a known manner, during its use, the particle filter is subjected to a succession of filtration phases (accumulation of soot) and of regeneration (elimination of soot). during the filtration phases, the soot particles emitted by the engine are retained and deposited inside the filter. during the regeneration phases, the soot particles are burned inside the filter, in order to restore thereto its filtration properties. the porous structure is then subjected to intense thermo-mechanical stresses, which may cause micro-cracks that are likely over time to cause a severe loss of the filtration capabilities of the unit, and even its complete deactivation. this phenomenon is particularly observed on large diameter monolithic filters. specifically, in the operation of an exhaust line, it has been observed that the temperature gradient between the center and the periphery of such structures increases as the dimensions of the monolith increase.
to solve these problems and increase the service life of the filters, filtration structures have more recently been proposed combining several monolithic honeycomb blocks or elements. the elements are most frequently assembled together by bonding by means of an adhesive or a cement of a ceramic nature, called in the rest of the description a joint cement. examples of such filtering structures are for example described in patent applications ep 816 065, ep 1 142 619, ep 1 455 923, wo 2004/090294 or else wo 2005/063462. in order to provide a better relaxation of the stresses in an assembled structure, it is known that the heat expansion coefficients of the various portions of the structure (filtration elements, coating cement, joint cement) must be substantially of the same order. consequently, said portions are advantageously synthesized based on one and the same material, most frequently silicon carbide sic or cordierite. this choice also makes it possible to even out the heat distribution during the regeneration of the filter.
to increase the filtration surface of said filter, at a constant filter volume, filtering elements whose shape and internal volume of the inlet and outlet channels are different have been proposed, for example in patent application wo 05/016491. in such structures, the wall elements succeed one another, in cross section and along a horizontal and/or vertical row of channels, to define a sinusoidal or wavy shape. the wall elements undulate typically by a half sine wave period over the width of a channel.
to improve the thermomechanical strength of the elements having such a wavy shape of the channels and consequently of the filter assembled from said elements having this particular channel shape, a honeycomb structure has been proposed in wo 05/063462 whose ratio r, characterizing two adjacent peripheral channels, between the average thickness ?œe??of the set of outer walls and the average thickness ?œe??of the set of inner walls of said channels, is greater than 1.2. it is indicated in this application that such a configuration makes it possible to reduce the risk of cracks that may appear particularly when local high amplitude stresses are generated during the regeneration phases, particularly due to high temperature gradients existing within the filter and the different types of materials used for the monolithic elements and the joint cement.
although such an increased thickness of the walls indeed makes it possible to significantly improve the thermomechanical strength of the filters assembled from such elements, it nevertheless also causes a not insignificant weight increase of the filters, typically of the order of 5.5 to 7.5%.
this weight increase has the disadvantage of increasing the thermal inertia of the filter, which causes an excess consumption during the regeneration phases and, when the filter incorporates a catalytic component, impairs its catalytic efficiency due to the increased activation (or energizing) time of the catalyzer.
the essential object of the present invention is to provide elements for the formation of a filter retaining the good thermomechanical properties of the previously described filters with reinforced wall, but whose total weight is substantially reduced.
more precisely, the invention relates to a monolithic honeycomb element comprising a set of adjacent ducts or channels with axes parallel with one another separated by porous walls, said ducts being stopped by plugs at one or other of their ends to delimit inlet ducts opening on a gas intake face and outlet ducts opening on a gas discharge face, so that the gas passes through the porous walls, wherein the peripheral channels forming part of the outer wall of said element are configured to help in the formation of an outer wall whose inner face is substantially flat over the whole length of the element and wherein said flat wall also has an increased thickness at the corners, so that, on a cross section, the ratio r of the thickness ec of the wall, measured along the bisecting line of the angle at a corner of the element, over the minimal thickness emin of said wall is greater than 1.5, and preferably greater than 1.6, or even 1.7.
preferably, the monolithic element has, in cross section, a periodic undulation of the walls of the inner channels making it possible to increase the overall volume of said inlet channels at the expense of the outlet channels.
usually the thickness emin of said outer wall is measured in the middle of a side of the element.
according to a possible embodiment of the invention, said increased thickness extends, from each corner of the element, over a portion of the outer walls and said increased thickness is continuous and constant over said portion.
according to an alternative embodiment, said increased thickness extends, from each corner of the element, over a portion of the outer walls and said increased thickness is continuous and decreasing over said portion.
advantageously, according to the invention, said increased thickness extends, from each corner of the element, over a total surface area equal to at least one eighth and preferably equal to at least one quarter of the total surface area of the inner faces of the outer walls.
according to the invention, the ratio of the thickness ec of the outer wall, measured along the bisecting line of the angle at a corner of the element, over the average thickness e of the inner walls of the channels is for example greater than 2.7, preferably greater than 3.5.
in addition, the thickness ec of the wall, measured along the bisecting line of the angle at a corner of the element, generally lies between 150 and 5000 microns, preferably between 700 and 2000 microns, preferably still between 1000 and 1300 microns.
similarly, the thickness emin of said wall at the center of a side of the element advantageously lies between 100 and 3500 microns, preferably between 450 and 1300 microns, preferably still between 600 and 900 microns.
typically, the average thickness e of the inner walls of the channels lies between 100 and 400 microns, preferably between 200 and 350 microns.
the invention also relates to a filter obtained by the assembly of a plurality of monolithic elements described hereinabove, said elements being connected together by a joint cement.
advantageously, within the filter, said elements and the joint cement are based on one and the same ceramic material, preferably based on silicon carbide sic.

US07658862,dust suppressant composition,"the present invention relates to a dust suppressant composition comprising a aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol, acrylic-based latex, glycerin, silicone based surfactant and a polysiloxane-based wetting agent. preferably, the composition comprises from about 10 to about 46% of polyvinyl alcohol, from about 20 to about 60% of an acrylic-based latex, from about 0.6 to about 7.0% of glycerin, from about 0.1 to about 1.5% of silicone-based surfactant and from about 0.001 to about 0.5% of polysiloxane-based wetting agent. the composition provides a polymer film over a dusting material thus forming a homogeneous and resistant layer. the instant composition, which is applied over the dusting material (preferably sprayed over the material) and dried at room temperature, presents a low surface tension resulting in better wetting of the particulates and agglomeration of the material. the latter two properties ensure that there is less breakage of the polymer film during continuous use or application (e.g. during transportation of the dusting materials). said surface tension is between about 20 and about 27 dynes/cm, and preferably of about 25 dynes/cm.","the instant invention relates to an aqueous composition for use as dust suppressant.
the presence of particulate matter (i.e. dust) is a serious hazard with respect to the environment and in general, to the personal health and safety of individuals exposed to it. examples of dust forming material include iron ores, coal and other friable (i.e. a material that is easily broken up into small pieces) materials. said materials are heretofore referred to as dusting materials.
dust can already be in existence or be produced as a result of mechanical operations such as mining, loading, transportation, storage and handling processes of dusting materials. dust suppression, as used herein, is defined as the prevention or reduction of the amount of fine particulates airborne or suspended in the air.
there are chemical and mechanical methods for dust suppression. mechanical methods include dust collection equipments such as filters and cyclones. they may capture entrained dust, induce dust to settle, ventilate the area where dust is formed, etc. chemical methods include short and long term residual suppressants.
long term residual dust suppressants control dust through the formation of a polymer or binder film over the dusting material. the film remains over said material after evaporation of the solvent (e.g. water). water is included in long term residual suppressants in order to provide an even spreading of the composition on the dusting material and they usually include film-forming or tackifying resins.
one of the most common short term dust suppressants is water. one disadvantage of using this method lies on the fact that large quantities of water may be needed in order to fully wet the material. when used in coal, for example, it results in the decrease of its specific heating value. another disadvantage is that water loses its effectiveness upon evaporation, thus it is not indicated for materials that are going to be transported for several days in opened carts. additives such as surfactants and wetting agents may be used to improve properties of the composition. examples of short term suppressants are described in patent application 20050085407, u.s. pat. no. 6,124,366 and u.s. pat. no. 5,409,626.
foam suppressants form a layer over the dusting material and may be used to capture dust through its bubbles. as a result, the suppressant is only effective while the bubbles are present in the homogeneous layer.
some currently available compositions are not immediately effective, therefore requiring an extended period of time for satisfactory performance. other compositions include excessive aromatic or other materials such as high levels of organic solvents.
to avoid the many problems encountered in dust reduction and to provide better means for minimizing the amount of dust escaping to the environment, a large number of products and processes have been extensively described in the literature, ranging from the utilization of natural and synthetic polymers and also using mixtures and combinations of surfactants and organic solvents. for example, u.s. pat. no. 6,372,842 relates to a method of using an aqueous composition or dispersion containing a water-soluble or water-dispersible synthetic polymer, made of acrylate esters and alkyl substituted acrylamide and modified with an organosilane, useful for dust control and other applications, like an agricultural spray composition.

the presence of particulate matter (i.e. dust) is a serious hazard with respect to the environment and in general, to the personal health and safety of individuals exposed to it. examples of dust forming material include iron ores, coal and other friable (i.e. a material that is easily broken up into small pieces) materials. said materials are heretofore referred to as dusting materials.
dust can already be in existence or be produced as a result of mechanical operations such as mining, loading, transportation, storage and handling processes of dusting materials. dust suppression, as used herein, is defined as the prevention or reduction of the amount of fine particulates airborne or suspended in the air.
there are chemical and mechanical methods for dust suppression. mechanical methods include dust collection equipments such as filters and cyclones. they may capture entrained dust, induce dust to settle, ventilate the area where dust is formed, etc. chemical methods include short and long term residual suppressants.
long term residual dust suppressants control dust through the formation of a polymer or binder film over the dusting material. the film remains over said material after evaporation of the solvent (e.g. water). water is included in long term residual suppressants in order to provide an even spreading of the composition on the dusting material and they usually include film-forming or tackifying resins.
one of the most common short term dust suppressants is water. one disadvantage of using this method lies on the fact that large quantities of water may be needed in order to fully wet the material. when used in coal, for example, it results in the decrease of its specific heating value. another disadvantage is that water loses its effectiveness upon evaporation, thus it is not indicated for materials that are going to be transported for several days in opened carts. additives such as surfactants and wetting agents may be used to improve properties of the composition. examples of short term suppressants are described in patent application 20050085407, u.s. pat. no. 6,124,366 and u.s. pat. no. 5,409,626.
foam suppressants form a layer over the dusting material and may be used to capture dust through its bubbles. as a result, the suppressant is only effective while the bubbles are present in the homogeneous layer.
some currently available compositions are not immediately effective, therefore requiring an extended period of time for satisfactory performance. other compositions include excessive aromatic or other materials such as high levels of organic solvents.

foam suppressants form a layer over the dusting material and may be used to capture dust through its bubbles. as a result, the suppressant is only effective while the bubbles are present in the homogeneous layer.
some currently available compositions are not immediately effective, therefore requiring an extended period of time for satisfactory performance. other compositions include excessive aromatic or other materials such as high levels of organic solvents.
to avoid the many problems encountered in dust reduction and to provide better means for minimizing the amount of dust escaping to the environment, a large number of products and processes have been extensively described in the literature, ranging from the utilization of natural and synthetic polymers and also using mixtures and combinations of surfactants and organic solvents. for example, u.s. pat. no. 6,372,842 relates to a method of using an aqueous composition or dispersion containing a water-soluble or water-dispersible synthetic polymer, made of acrylate esters and alkyl substituted acrylamide and modified with an organosilane, useful for dust control and other applications, like an agricultural spray composition.

u.s. pat. no. 4,264,333 describes a method wherein the coal is first coated with a wetting agent and then coated with an emulsion of crude coal tar in water containing a cationic emulsifying agent.
wetting agents such as ethylene oxide may be used as described in u.s. pat. no. 4,316,811 and u.s. pat. no. 4,369,121

the use of emulsions is described in u.s. pat. no. 4,650,598 and u.s. pat. no. 4,981,398.
aromatic solvents may be used as described in u.s. pat. no. 4,960,532 which relates to a dust suppressant composition comprising water and a thickening agent forming the dispersion medium and coal tar pitch and aromatic solvent forming the dispersed liquid. said composition forms a resilient layer.
patent application us 20050045853 describes a method and composition for suppressing coal dust including a metal-containing compound mixed with any appropriate dust suppressant liquid.
the instant invention relates to an aqueous composition for use as dust suppressant. more particularly, the invention relates to an aqueous solution comprising polyvinyl alcohol, acrylic-based latex, glycerin, silicone based surfactant and a polysiloxane-based wetting agent.
the composition described herein provides a polymer film over the dusting material which due to cohesive forces forms a homogeneous and resistant layer. another characteristic of the composition relates to its low surface tension resulting in a better wetting of the particulates and agglomeration of the material. as a result, less breakage of the formed film is observed.
the composition is applied over the dusting material, preferably through spray nozzles, and dried at room temperature.

US07658898,compositions and methods for treating exhaust gases,"the present invention provides compositions, systems, and methods for achieving high efficiencies of nitrogen oxide (nox) removal from exhaust gases while minimizing ammonia slip and sulfur dioxide oxidation. in one embodiment, a method of removing nitrogen oxides from an exhaust gas comprises providing a first catalyst layer, adding an ammonia-containing compound to the exhaust gas upstream of the first catalyst layer in excess of the stoichiometric equivalent of the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, flowing the exhaust gas through the first catalyst layer, selectively catalytically decomposing ammonia in excess of the stoichiometric reaction equivalent of the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, and catalytically reducing the nitrogen oxides by reaction with ammonia not selectively catalytically decomposed.","the present invention relates to compositions and methods for treating exhaust gases and, in particular, to the removal of nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases.
the hazards of nitrogen oxides and their role in the formation of acid rain and tropospheric ozone have resulted in the imposition of strict standards limiting the discharges of these chemical species. to meet these standards, it is generally necessary to remove at least part of these oxides present in the exhaust gases from stationary or mobile combustion sources.
denitrification or selective catalytic reduction (scr) technology is commonly applied to combustion-derived flue gases for removal of nitrogen oxides. the denitrification reaction comprises the reaction of nitrogen oxide species in the gases, such as nitrogen oxide (no) or nitrogen dioxide (no2), with a nitrogen containing reductant, such as ammonia or urea, resulting in the production of benign diatomic nitrogen (n2) and water.
in a typical application, catalyst responsible for conducting the reduction of nitrogen oxides is installed in the path of the flue gas flow and ammonia is injected upstream of the catalyst. the scr system, including the housing, catalyst bed, ammonia injection system controls, and mixing and/or flow control devices, is designed to remove a certain amount of nox, while staying within a specified maximum level of nh3 slip downstream of the catalyst, a maximum level of oxidation of so2 (sulfur dioxide) to so3 (sulfur trioxide), and a maximum pressure loss across the catalyst. ammonia slip, as used herein, refers to the amount of ammonia present in the exhaust gas stream at the outlet of a catalyst.
sulfur dioxide oxidation is an undesirable side reaction promoted by scr catalysts. the maximum limit for sulfur dioxide oxidation is specified to minimize the increase in sulfur trioxide downstream of the catalyst. increased levels of sulfur trioxide can contribute to fouling of downstream equipment, can result in a visible plume at the exhaust stack of the combustion facility and increase particulate matter emissions.
similarly, a maximum level of ammonia slip is specified to limit emissions of ammonia from the exhaust, and also to prevent the formation of ammonia salts, such as ammonium bisulfate that result from reaction between ammonia and other flue gas components such as sulfur trioxide. ammonia salts can foul downstream equipment.
in scr processes, the reaction between nox and nh3 generally occurs at a stoichiometry of one mole of nox per one mole of ammonia:

4no+4nh3+o2??n2+6h2o?ƒâ€?1)

2no+2no2+4nh3??n2+6h2o?ƒâ€?2)

the reaction is not thermodynamically limited at typical scr temperatures, so if the molar ratio of nh3 to nox (or nh3/nox) at the catalyst inlet is 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, the reduction of nox and consumption of ammonia both approach 100%, and there is essentially no nox and no ammonia slip at the outlet of the catalyst. if the molar ratio is less than 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, then the nox reduction efficiency approaches the molar ratio and the ammonia slip approaches zero. if the molar ratio is greater than 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, then nox reduction efficiency approaches 100% and all excess ammonia slips past the catalyst.
in actual applications, however, it is difficult to attain a consistent molar ratio of nh3/nox across the entire catalyst bed. there is typically a heterogeneous distribution of nh3/nox across the catalyst bed stemming from several factors including a heterogeneous distribution of nox in the exhaust gas, addition of the ammonia at discrete points upstream of the catalyst bed as well as imperfect mixing of the nh3 and nox downstream of these addition points.
several techniques currently exist for reducing heterogeneous distributions of nh3/nox across a catalyst bed. ammonia flow to discrete points, for example, can be biased to match the molar flow of nox as determined by the nox concentration and flow at a particular section. sufficient mixing length and static mixers are additionally employed downstream of the ammonia injection points in order to obtain mixing prior to the catalyst bed. with these measures in place, in some cases, nox reduction efficiencies of 93% and 3 ppmvd ammonia slip have been achieved.
achieving higher nox reductions (i.e. >95%), nevertheless, remains limited by the heterogeneous distribution of the nh3/nox molar ratio across the catalyst bed. nh3/nox molar ratios in excess of equivalence (1.0) can be run to obtain high nox reduction efficiencies. nh3/nox molar ratios in excess of equivalence, however, result in undesirable ammonia slip. moreover, attempts to limit such slip with additional catalytic structures can result in undesirable oxidation of sulfur dioxide.
in view of these problems, it would be desirable to provide compositions and methods for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases operable to achieve high efficiencies while minimizing ammonia slip. it would additionally be desirable to provide compositions and methods for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases operable to achieve high efficiencies while minimizing ammonia slip and sulfur dioxide oxidation.

these and other embodiments of the present invention are described in greater detail in the detailed description which follows. these and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed embodiments and claims.",2,problem,formation of acid rain,1.0,exact,1
US07658898,compositions and methods for treating exhaust gases,"the present invention provides compositions, systems, and methods for achieving high efficiencies of nitrogen oxide (nox) removal from exhaust gases while minimizing ammonia slip and sulfur dioxide oxidation. in one embodiment, a method of removing nitrogen oxides from an exhaust gas comprises providing a first catalyst layer, adding an ammonia-containing compound to the exhaust gas upstream of the first catalyst layer in excess of the stoichiometric equivalent of the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, flowing the exhaust gas through the first catalyst layer, selectively catalytically decomposing ammonia in excess of the stoichiometric reaction equivalent of the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, and catalytically reducing the nitrogen oxides by reaction with ammonia not selectively catalytically decomposed.","the present invention relates to compositions and methods for treating exhaust gases and, in particular, to the removal of nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases.
the hazards of nitrogen oxides and their role in the formation of acid rain and tropospheric ozone have resulted in the imposition of strict standards limiting the discharges of these chemical species. to meet these standards, it is generally necessary to remove at least part of these oxides present in the exhaust gases from stationary or mobile combustion sources.
denitrification or selective catalytic reduction (scr) technology is commonly applied to combustion-derived flue gases for removal of nitrogen oxides. the denitrification reaction comprises the reaction of nitrogen oxide species in the gases, such as nitrogen oxide (no) or nitrogen dioxide (no2), with a nitrogen containing reductant, such as ammonia or urea, resulting in the production of benign diatomic nitrogen (n2) and water.
in a typical application, catalyst responsible for conducting the reduction of nitrogen oxides is installed in the path of the flue gas flow and ammonia is injected upstream of the catalyst. the scr system, including the housing, catalyst bed, ammonia injection system controls, and mixing and/or flow control devices, is designed to remove a certain amount of nox, while staying within a specified maximum level of nh3 slip downstream of the catalyst, a maximum level of oxidation of so2 (sulfur dioxide) to so3 (sulfur trioxide), and a maximum pressure loss across the catalyst. ammonia slip, as used herein, refers to the amount of ammonia present in the exhaust gas stream at the outlet of a catalyst.
sulfur dioxide oxidation is an undesirable side reaction promoted by scr catalysts. the maximum limit for sulfur dioxide oxidation is specified to minimize the increase in sulfur trioxide downstream of the catalyst. increased levels of sulfur trioxide can contribute to fouling of downstream equipment, can result in a visible plume at the exhaust stack of the combustion facility and increase particulate matter emissions.
similarly, a maximum level of ammonia slip is specified to limit emissions of ammonia from the exhaust, and also to prevent the formation of ammonia salts, such as ammonium bisulfate that result from reaction between ammonia and other flue gas components such as sulfur trioxide. ammonia salts can foul downstream equipment.
in scr processes, the reaction between nox and nh3 generally occurs at a stoichiometry of one mole of nox per one mole of ammonia:

4no+4nh3+o2??n2+6h2o?ƒâ€?1)

2no+2no2+4nh3??n2+6h2o?ƒâ€?2)

the reaction is not thermodynamically limited at typical scr temperatures, so if the molar ratio of nh3 to nox (or nh3/nox) at the catalyst inlet is 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, the reduction of nox and consumption of ammonia both approach 100%, and there is essentially no nox and no ammonia slip at the outlet of the catalyst. if the molar ratio is less than 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, then the nox reduction efficiency approaches the molar ratio and the ammonia slip approaches zero. if the molar ratio is greater than 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, then nox reduction efficiency approaches 100% and all excess ammonia slips past the catalyst.
in actual applications, however, it is difficult to attain a consistent molar ratio of nh3/nox across the entire catalyst bed. there is typically a heterogeneous distribution of nh3/nox across the catalyst bed stemming from several factors including a heterogeneous distribution of nox in the exhaust gas, addition of the ammonia at discrete points upstream of the catalyst bed as well as imperfect mixing of the nh3 and nox downstream of these addition points.
several techniques currently exist for reducing heterogeneous distributions of nh3/nox across a catalyst bed. ammonia flow to discrete points, for example, can be biased to match the molar flow of nox as determined by the nox concentration and flow at a particular section. sufficient mixing length and static mixers are additionally employed downstream of the ammonia injection points in order to obtain mixing prior to the catalyst bed. with these measures in place, in some cases, nox reduction efficiencies of 93% and 3 ppmvd ammonia slip have been achieved.
achieving higher nox reductions (i.e. >95%), nevertheless, remains limited by the heterogeneous distribution of the nh3/nox molar ratio across the catalyst bed. nh3/nox molar ratios in excess of equivalence (1.0) can be run to obtain high nox reduction efficiencies. nh3/nox molar ratios in excess of equivalence, however, result in undesirable ammonia slip. moreover, attempts to limit such slip with additional catalytic structures can result in undesirable oxidation of sulfur dioxide.
in view of these problems, it would be desirable to provide compositions and methods for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases operable to achieve high efficiencies while minimizing ammonia slip. it would additionally be desirable to provide compositions and methods for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases operable to achieve high efficiencies while minimizing ammonia slip and sulfur dioxide oxidation.

these and other embodiments of the present invention are described in greater detail in the detailed description which follows. these and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed embodiments and claims.",4,problem,strict standards limiting the discharges of these chemical species,1.0,exact,-1
US07658898,compositions and methods for treating exhaust gases,"the present invention provides compositions, systems, and methods for achieving high efficiencies of nitrogen oxide (nox) removal from exhaust gases while minimizing ammonia slip and sulfur dioxide oxidation. in one embodiment, a method of removing nitrogen oxides from an exhaust gas comprises providing a first catalyst layer, adding an ammonia-containing compound to the exhaust gas upstream of the first catalyst layer in excess of the stoichiometric equivalent of the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, flowing the exhaust gas through the first catalyst layer, selectively catalytically decomposing ammonia in excess of the stoichiometric reaction equivalent of the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, and catalytically reducing the nitrogen oxides by reaction with ammonia not selectively catalytically decomposed.","the present invention relates to compositions and methods for treating exhaust gases and, in particular, to the removal of nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases.
the hazards of nitrogen oxides and their role in the formation of acid rain and tropospheric ozone have resulted in the imposition of strict standards limiting the discharges of these chemical species. to meet these standards, it is generally necessary to remove at least part of these oxides present in the exhaust gases from stationary or mobile combustion sources.
denitrification or selective catalytic reduction (scr) technology is commonly applied to combustion-derived flue gases for removal of nitrogen oxides. the denitrification reaction comprises the reaction of nitrogen oxide species in the gases, such as nitrogen oxide (no) or nitrogen dioxide (no2), with a nitrogen containing reductant, such as ammonia or urea, resulting in the production of benign diatomic nitrogen (n2) and water.
in a typical application, catalyst responsible for conducting the reduction of nitrogen oxides is installed in the path of the flue gas flow and ammonia is injected upstream of the catalyst. the scr system, including the housing, catalyst bed, ammonia injection system controls, and mixing and/or flow control devices, is designed to remove a certain amount of nox, while staying within a specified maximum level of nh3 slip downstream of the catalyst, a maximum level of oxidation of so2 (sulfur dioxide) to so3 (sulfur trioxide), and a maximum pressure loss across the catalyst. ammonia slip, as used herein, refers to the amount of ammonia present in the exhaust gas stream at the outlet of a catalyst.
sulfur dioxide oxidation is an undesirable side reaction promoted by scr catalysts. the maximum limit for sulfur dioxide oxidation is specified to minimize the increase in sulfur trioxide downstream of the catalyst. increased levels of sulfur trioxide can contribute to fouling of downstream equipment, can result in a visible plume at the exhaust stack of the combustion facility and increase particulate matter emissions.
similarly, a maximum level of ammonia slip is specified to limit emissions of ammonia from the exhaust, and also to prevent the formation of ammonia salts, such as ammonium bisulfate that result from reaction between ammonia and other flue gas components such as sulfur trioxide. ammonia salts can foul downstream equipment.
in scr processes, the reaction between nox and nh3 generally occurs at a stoichiometry of one mole of nox per one mole of ammonia:

4no+4nh3+o2??n2+6h2o?ƒâ€?1)

2no+2no2+4nh3??n2+6h2o?ƒâ€?2)

the reaction is not thermodynamically limited at typical scr temperatures, so if the molar ratio of nh3 to nox (or nh3/nox) at the catalyst inlet is 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, the reduction of nox and consumption of ammonia both approach 100%, and there is essentially no nox and no ammonia slip at the outlet of the catalyst. if the molar ratio is less than 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, then the nox reduction efficiency approaches the molar ratio and the ammonia slip approaches zero. if the molar ratio is greater than 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, then nox reduction efficiency approaches 100% and all excess ammonia slips past the catalyst.
in actual applications, however, it is difficult to attain a consistent molar ratio of nh3/nox across the entire catalyst bed. there is typically a heterogeneous distribution of nh3/nox across the catalyst bed stemming from several factors including a heterogeneous distribution of nox in the exhaust gas, addition of the ammonia at discrete points upstream of the catalyst bed as well as imperfect mixing of the nh3 and nox downstream of these addition points.
several techniques currently exist for reducing heterogeneous distributions of nh3/nox across a catalyst bed. ammonia flow to discrete points, for example, can be biased to match the molar flow of nox as determined by the nox concentration and flow at a particular section. sufficient mixing length and static mixers are additionally employed downstream of the ammonia injection points in order to obtain mixing prior to the catalyst bed. with these measures in place, in some cases, nox reduction efficiencies of 93% and 3 ppmvd ammonia slip have been achieved.
achieving higher nox reductions (i.e. >95%), nevertheless, remains limited by the heterogeneous distribution of the nh3/nox molar ratio across the catalyst bed. nh3/nox molar ratios in excess of equivalence (1.0) can be run to obtain high nox reduction efficiencies. nh3/nox molar ratios in excess of equivalence, however, result in undesirable ammonia slip. moreover, attempts to limit such slip with additional catalytic structures can result in undesirable oxidation of sulfur dioxide.
in view of these problems, it would be desirable to provide compositions and methods for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases operable to achieve high efficiencies while minimizing ammonia slip. it would additionally be desirable to provide compositions and methods for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases operable to achieve high efficiencies while minimizing ammonia slip and sulfur dioxide oxidation.

these and other embodiments of the present invention are described in greater detail in the detailed description which follows. these and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed embodiments and claims.",6,problem,fouling of downstream equipment,1.0,exact,3
US07658898,compositions and methods for treating exhaust gases,"the present invention provides compositions, systems, and methods for achieving high efficiencies of nitrogen oxide (nox) removal from exhaust gases while minimizing ammonia slip and sulfur dioxide oxidation. in one embodiment, a method of removing nitrogen oxides from an exhaust gas comprises providing a first catalyst layer, adding an ammonia-containing compound to the exhaust gas upstream of the first catalyst layer in excess of the stoichiometric equivalent of the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, flowing the exhaust gas through the first catalyst layer, selectively catalytically decomposing ammonia in excess of the stoichiometric reaction equivalent of the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, and catalytically reducing the nitrogen oxides by reaction with ammonia not selectively catalytically decomposed.","the present invention relates to compositions and methods for treating exhaust gases and, in particular, to the removal of nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases.
the hazards of nitrogen oxides and their role in the formation of acid rain and tropospheric ozone have resulted in the imposition of strict standards limiting the discharges of these chemical species. to meet these standards, it is generally necessary to remove at least part of these oxides present in the exhaust gases from stationary or mobile combustion sources.
denitrification or selective catalytic reduction (scr) technology is commonly applied to combustion-derived flue gases for removal of nitrogen oxides. the denitrification reaction comprises the reaction of nitrogen oxide species in the gases, such as nitrogen oxide (no) or nitrogen dioxide (no2), with a nitrogen containing reductant, such as ammonia or urea, resulting in the production of benign diatomic nitrogen (n2) and water.
in a typical application, catalyst responsible for conducting the reduction of nitrogen oxides is installed in the path of the flue gas flow and ammonia is injected upstream of the catalyst. the scr system, including the housing, catalyst bed, ammonia injection system controls, and mixing and/or flow control devices, is designed to remove a certain amount of nox, while staying within a specified maximum level of nh3 slip downstream of the catalyst, a maximum level of oxidation of so2 (sulfur dioxide) to so3 (sulfur trioxide), and a maximum pressure loss across the catalyst. ammonia slip, as used herein, refers to the amount of ammonia present in the exhaust gas stream at the outlet of a catalyst.
sulfur dioxide oxidation is an undesirable side reaction promoted by scr catalysts. the maximum limit for sulfur dioxide oxidation is specified to minimize the increase in sulfur trioxide downstream of the catalyst. increased levels of sulfur trioxide can contribute to fouling of downstream equipment, can result in a visible plume at the exhaust stack of the combustion facility and increase particulate matter emissions.
similarly, a maximum level of ammonia slip is specified to limit emissions of ammonia from the exhaust, and also to prevent the formation of ammonia salts, such as ammonium bisulfate that result from reaction between ammonia and other flue gas components such as sulfur trioxide. ammonia salts can foul downstream equipment.
in scr processes, the reaction between nox and nh3 generally occurs at a stoichiometry of one mole of nox per one mole of ammonia:

4no+4nh3+o2??n2+6h2o?ƒâ€?1)

2no+2no2+4nh3??n2+6h2o?ƒâ€?2)

the reaction is not thermodynamically limited at typical scr temperatures, so if the molar ratio of nh3 to nox (or nh3/nox) at the catalyst inlet is 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, the reduction of nox and consumption of ammonia both approach 100%, and there is essentially no nox and no ammonia slip at the outlet of the catalyst. if the molar ratio is less than 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, then the nox reduction efficiency approaches the molar ratio and the ammonia slip approaches zero. if the molar ratio is greater than 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, then nox reduction efficiency approaches 100% and all excess ammonia slips past the catalyst.
in actual applications, however, it is difficult to attain a consistent molar ratio of nh3/nox across the entire catalyst bed. there is typically a heterogeneous distribution of nh3/nox across the catalyst bed stemming from several factors including a heterogeneous distribution of nox in the exhaust gas, addition of the ammonia at discrete points upstream of the catalyst bed as well as imperfect mixing of the nh3 and nox downstream of these addition points.
several techniques currently exist for reducing heterogeneous distributions of nh3/nox across a catalyst bed. ammonia flow to discrete points, for example, can be biased to match the molar flow of nox as determined by the nox concentration and flow at a particular section. sufficient mixing length and static mixers are additionally employed downstream of the ammonia injection points in order to obtain mixing prior to the catalyst bed. with these measures in place, in some cases, nox reduction efficiencies of 93% and 3 ppmvd ammonia slip have been achieved.
achieving higher nox reductions (i.e. >95%), nevertheless, remains limited by the heterogeneous distribution of the nh3/nox molar ratio across the catalyst bed. nh3/nox molar ratios in excess of equivalence (1.0) can be run to obtain high nox reduction efficiencies. nh3/nox molar ratios in excess of equivalence, however, result in undesirable ammonia slip. moreover, attempts to limit such slip with additional catalytic structures can result in undesirable oxidation of sulfur dioxide.
in view of these problems, it would be desirable to provide compositions and methods for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases operable to achieve high efficiencies while minimizing ammonia slip. it would additionally be desirable to provide compositions and methods for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases operable to achieve high efficiencies while minimizing ammonia slip and sulfur dioxide oxidation.

US07658898,compositions and methods for treating exhaust gases,"the present invention provides compositions, systems, and methods for achieving high efficiencies of nitrogen oxide (nox) removal from exhaust gases while minimizing ammonia slip and sulfur dioxide oxidation. in one embodiment, a method of removing nitrogen oxides from an exhaust gas comprises providing a first catalyst layer, adding an ammonia-containing compound to the exhaust gas upstream of the first catalyst layer in excess of the stoichiometric equivalent of the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, flowing the exhaust gas through the first catalyst layer, selectively catalytically decomposing ammonia in excess of the stoichiometric reaction equivalent of the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, and catalytically reducing the nitrogen oxides by reaction with ammonia not selectively catalytically decomposed.","the present invention relates to compositions and methods for treating exhaust gases and, in particular, to the removal of nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases.
the hazards of nitrogen oxides and their role in the formation of acid rain and tropospheric ozone have resulted in the imposition of strict standards limiting the discharges of these chemical species. to meet these standards, it is generally necessary to remove at least part of these oxides present in the exhaust gases from stationary or mobile combustion sources.
denitrification or selective catalytic reduction (scr) technology is commonly applied to combustion-derived flue gases for removal of nitrogen oxides. the denitrification reaction comprises the reaction of nitrogen oxide species in the gases, such as nitrogen oxide (no) or nitrogen dioxide (no2), with a nitrogen containing reductant, such as ammonia or urea, resulting in the production of benign diatomic nitrogen (n2) and water.
in a typical application, catalyst responsible for conducting the reduction of nitrogen oxides is installed in the path of the flue gas flow and ammonia is injected upstream of the catalyst. the scr system, including the housing, catalyst bed, ammonia injection system controls, and mixing and/or flow control devices, is designed to remove a certain amount of nox, while staying within a specified maximum level of nh3 slip downstream of the catalyst, a maximum level of oxidation of so2 (sulfur dioxide) to so3 (sulfur trioxide), and a maximum pressure loss across the catalyst. ammonia slip, as used herein, refers to the amount of ammonia present in the exhaust gas stream at the outlet of a catalyst.
sulfur dioxide oxidation is an undesirable side reaction promoted by scr catalysts. the maximum limit for sulfur dioxide oxidation is specified to minimize the increase in sulfur trioxide downstream of the catalyst. increased levels of sulfur trioxide can contribute to fouling of downstream equipment, can result in a visible plume at the exhaust stack of the combustion facility and increase particulate matter emissions.
similarly, a maximum level of ammonia slip is specified to limit emissions of ammonia from the exhaust, and also to prevent the formation of ammonia salts, such as ammonium bisulfate that result from reaction between ammonia and other flue gas components such as sulfur trioxide. ammonia salts can foul downstream equipment.
in scr processes, the reaction between nox and nh3 generally occurs at a stoichiometry of one mole of nox per one mole of ammonia:

4no+4nh3+o2??n2+6h2o?ƒâ€?1)

2no+2no2+4nh3??n2+6h2o?ƒâ€?2)

the reaction is not thermodynamically limited at typical scr temperatures, so if the molar ratio of nh3 to nox (or nh3/nox) at the catalyst inlet is 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, the reduction of nox and consumption of ammonia both approach 100%, and there is essentially no nox and no ammonia slip at the outlet of the catalyst. if the molar ratio is less than 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, then the nox reduction efficiency approaches the molar ratio and the ammonia slip approaches zero. if the molar ratio is greater than 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, then nox reduction efficiency approaches 100% and all excess ammonia slips past the catalyst.
in actual applications, however, it is difficult to attain a consistent molar ratio of nh3/nox across the entire catalyst bed. there is typically a heterogeneous distribution of nh3/nox across the catalyst bed stemming from several factors including a heterogeneous distribution of nox in the exhaust gas, addition of the ammonia at discrete points upstream of the catalyst bed as well as imperfect mixing of the nh3 and nox downstream of these addition points.
several techniques currently exist for reducing heterogeneous distributions of nh3/nox across a catalyst bed. ammonia flow to discrete points, for example, can be biased to match the molar flow of nox as determined by the nox concentration and flow at a particular section. sufficient mixing length and static mixers are additionally employed downstream of the ammonia injection points in order to obtain mixing prior to the catalyst bed. with these measures in place, in some cases, nox reduction efficiencies of 93% and 3 ppmvd ammonia slip have been achieved.
achieving higher nox reductions (i.e. >95%), nevertheless, remains limited by the heterogeneous distribution of the nh3/nox molar ratio across the catalyst bed. nh3/nox molar ratios in excess of equivalence (1.0) can be run to obtain high nox reduction efficiencies. nh3/nox molar ratios in excess of equivalence, however, result in undesirable ammonia slip. moreover, attempts to limit such slip with additional catalytic structures can result in undesirable oxidation of sulfur dioxide.
in view of these problems, it would be desirable to provide compositions and methods for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases operable to achieve high efficiencies while minimizing ammonia slip. it would additionally be desirable to provide compositions and methods for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases operable to achieve high efficiencies while minimizing ammonia slip and sulfur dioxide oxidation.
the present invention provides compositions, systems, and methods for achieving high efficiencies of nox removal from exhaust gases while minimizing ammonia slip and sulfur dioxide oxidation.

US07658898,compositions and methods for treating exhaust gases,"the present invention provides compositions, systems, and methods for achieving high efficiencies of nitrogen oxide (nox) removal from exhaust gases while minimizing ammonia slip and sulfur dioxide oxidation. in one embodiment, a method of removing nitrogen oxides from an exhaust gas comprises providing a first catalyst layer, adding an ammonia-containing compound to the exhaust gas upstream of the first catalyst layer in excess of the stoichiometric equivalent of the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, flowing the exhaust gas through the first catalyst layer, selectively catalytically decomposing ammonia in excess of the stoichiometric reaction equivalent of the nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, and catalytically reducing the nitrogen oxides by reaction with ammonia not selectively catalytically decomposed.","the present invention relates to compositions and methods for treating exhaust gases and, in particular, to the removal of nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases.
the hazards of nitrogen oxides and their role in the formation of acid rain and tropospheric ozone have resulted in the imposition of strict standards limiting the discharges of these chemical species. to meet these standards, it is generally necessary to remove at least part of these oxides present in the exhaust gases from stationary or mobile combustion sources.
denitrification or selective catalytic reduction (scr) technology is commonly applied to combustion-derived flue gases for removal of nitrogen oxides. the denitrification reaction comprises the reaction of nitrogen oxide species in the gases, such as nitrogen oxide (no) or nitrogen dioxide (no2), with a nitrogen containing reductant, such as ammonia or urea, resulting in the production of benign diatomic nitrogen (n2) and water.
in a typical application, catalyst responsible for conducting the reduction of nitrogen oxides is installed in the path of the flue gas flow and ammonia is injected upstream of the catalyst. the scr system, including the housing, catalyst bed, ammonia injection system controls, and mixing and/or flow control devices, is designed to remove a certain amount of nox, while staying within a specified maximum level of nh3 slip downstream of the catalyst, a maximum level of oxidation of so2 (sulfur dioxide) to so3 (sulfur trioxide), and a maximum pressure loss across the catalyst. ammonia slip, as used herein, refers to the amount of ammonia present in the exhaust gas stream at the outlet of a catalyst.
sulfur dioxide oxidation is an undesirable side reaction promoted by scr catalysts. the maximum limit for sulfur dioxide oxidation is specified to minimize the increase in sulfur trioxide downstream of the catalyst. increased levels of sulfur trioxide can contribute to fouling of downstream equipment, can result in a visible plume at the exhaust stack of the combustion facility and increase particulate matter emissions.
similarly, a maximum level of ammonia slip is specified to limit emissions of ammonia from the exhaust, and also to prevent the formation of ammonia salts, such as ammonium bisulfate that result from reaction between ammonia and other flue gas components such as sulfur trioxide. ammonia salts can foul downstream equipment.
in scr processes, the reaction between nox and nh3 generally occurs at a stoichiometry of one mole of nox per one mole of ammonia:

4no+4nh3+o2??n2+6h2o?ƒâ€?1)

2no+2no2+4nh3??n2+6h2o?ƒâ€?2)

the reaction is not thermodynamically limited at typical scr temperatures, so if the molar ratio of nh3 to nox (or nh3/nox) at the catalyst inlet is 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, the reduction of nox and consumption of ammonia both approach 100%, and there is essentially no nox and no ammonia slip at the outlet of the catalyst. if the molar ratio is less than 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, then the nox reduction efficiency approaches the molar ratio and the ammonia slip approaches zero. if the molar ratio is greater than 1.0 and a sufficient amount of catalyst is present, then nox reduction efficiency approaches 100% and all excess ammonia slips past the catalyst.
in actual applications, however, it is difficult to attain a consistent molar ratio of nh3/nox across the entire catalyst bed. there is typically a heterogeneous distribution of nh3/nox across the catalyst bed stemming from several factors including a heterogeneous distribution of nox in the exhaust gas, addition of the ammonia at discrete points upstream of the catalyst bed as well as imperfect mixing of the nh3 and nox downstream of these addition points.
several techniques currently exist for reducing heterogeneous distributions of nh3/nox across a catalyst bed. ammonia flow to discrete points, for example, can be biased to match the molar flow of nox as determined by the nox concentration and flow at a particular section. sufficient mixing length and static mixers are additionally employed downstream of the ammonia injection points in order to obtain mixing prior to the catalyst bed. with these measures in place, in some cases, nox reduction efficiencies of 93% and 3 ppmvd ammonia slip have been achieved.
achieving higher nox reductions (i.e. >95%), nevertheless, remains limited by the heterogeneous distribution of the nh3/nox molar ratio across the catalyst bed. nh3/nox molar ratios in excess of equivalence (1.0) can be run to obtain high nox reduction efficiencies. nh3/nox molar ratios in excess of equivalence, however, result in undesirable ammonia slip. moreover, attempts to limit such slip with additional catalytic structures can result in undesirable oxidation of sulfur dioxide.
in view of these problems, it would be desirable to provide compositions and methods for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases operable to achieve high efficiencies while minimizing ammonia slip. it would additionally be desirable to provide compositions and methods for removing nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases operable to achieve high efficiencies while minimizing ammonia slip and sulfur dioxide oxidation.
the present invention provides compositions, systems, and methods for achieving high efficiencies of nox removal from exhaust gases while minimizing ammonia slip and sulfur dioxide oxidation.

US07661263,method of operating an internal combustion engine,a method of operating an internal combustion engine includes operating the engine in a first combustion mode. the method also includes switching operation of the engine to a second combustion mode. the method includes directing an exhaust stream of the engine into contact with a nox adsorber substantially only during the operation in the second combustion mode.,"this invention relates generally to an internal combustion engine and more specifically to a method of operating an internal combustion engine in more than one combustion mode.
internal combustion engines are used extensively for a variety of purposes. the transportation infrastructure relies almost exclusively on the use of engines to provide power for mobility. electrical power generation also relies heavily on internal combustion engines.
the prolific use of engines in our society has created a number of issues, one of which is the ever-increasing amounts of combustion by-products being emitted. although today's engines operate with much lower emission levels than previous generations of engines, the rapidly increasing numbers of engines being used creates the need to reduce emission levels even more.
governments around the world recognize this problem and are taking regulatory steps to address the emission levels of engines. for example, levels of oxides of nitrogen (nox), hydrocarbons (hc), carbon monoxide (co), and smoke, among others, must be reduced drastically to meet evolving government standards.
spark ignition engines, by the nature of their operation and the types of fuel used, tend to produce low levels of nox and particulate emissions. compression ignition engines, for example diesel engines, generally produce higher levels of nox and particulate emissions. diesel engines, however, are still popular in use because they provide higher thermal efficiency than their spark-ignition counterparts, and thus offer higher power output for work applications.
one attempt to reduce the emissions of compression ignition engines has been the use of aftertreatment systems to alter or remove the unwanted emissions from the exhaust of the engines. one form of aftertreatment technology that has shown promise in reducing the nox emissions of compression ignition engines is nox adsorber technology, a catalyst technology. however, the successful implementation of nox adsorber technology has proven difficult. first, for sufficient nox reduction at low temperatures, nox adsorbers must have very high loadings of expensive noble metals. in fact, nox adsorbers that operate successfully in low temperature conditions may require as much as twice the noble metal content of nox adsorbers that only operate in higher temperature conditions. second, the effectiveness of nox adsorber technology in very low temperature conditions is questionable. to improve performance in these conditions, expensive and fuel intensive thermal management may be necessary. third, the catalyst of a nox adsorber is poisoned by sulfur, even at the current ultra low sulfur levels in fuel. this poisoning process reduces the overall lifespan of the catalyst.
another attempt to reduce the emissions of compression ignition engines has been the use of homogeneous charge compression ignition (hcci) combustion. engines that operate in hcci mode have generated much interest due to the potential to operate at high fuel efficiency while generating low combustion emissions. hcci engines differ from conventional diesel compression ignition engines in that diesel engines ignite fuel that is rich, i.e., highly concentrated, in an area in a combustion chamber, while hcci techniques create a dispersed homogeneous fuel/air mixture by the time of combustion. combustion of a homogeneous fuel/air mixture allows an engine to operate such that emission by-products are significantly reduced. however, successful implementation of hcci combustion at all engine load conditions has proven difficult. in high engine load conditions, hcci combustion causes high mechanical loading of engine parts due to a higher peak cylinder pressure than traditional diesel combustion. engine components having commonly used material compositions may not be able to withstand these higher pressures. also, in order to control the timing of hcci combustion in higher load conditions, significant structural changes may need to be made to the engine, including, for example, mechanisms for varying the compression ratio of the engine. one strategy for utilizing hcci combustion is disclosed in u.s. pat. no. 6,561,157, issued to zur loye et al. on 13 may 2003. in the '157 patent, pccl combustion, similar to hcci combustion, is used during some portions of an engine's operation, and other combustion modes, such as standard diesel mode, spark ignited mode, and homogeneous charge duel fuel transition mode, are used during other portions of the engine's operation.

in yet another embodiment of the present invention, a method of operating an internal combustion engine comprises causing an exhaust stream of an engine, where the engine is capable of selectively operating in an hcci combustion mode and at least one other combustion mode, to contact a nox adsorber substantially only during the at least one other combustion mode.

internal combustion engines are used extensively for a variety of purposes. the transportation infrastructure relies almost exclusively on the use of engines to provide power for mobility. electrical power generation also relies heavily on internal combustion engines.
the prolific use of engines in our society has created a number of issues, one of which is the ever-increasing amounts of combustion by-products being emitted. although today's engines operate with much lower emission levels than previous generations of engines, the rapidly increasing numbers of engines being used creates the need to reduce emission levels even more.
governments around the world recognize this problem and are taking regulatory steps to address the emission levels of engines. for example, levels of oxides of nitrogen (nox), hydrocarbons (hc), carbon monoxide (co), and smoke, among others, must be reduced drastically to meet evolving government standards.
spark ignition engines, by the nature of their operation and the types of fuel used, tend to produce low levels of nox and particulate emissions. compression ignition engines, for example diesel engines, generally produce higher levels of nox and particulate emissions. diesel engines, however, are still popular in use because they provide higher thermal efficiency than their spark-ignition counterparts, and thus offer higher power output for work applications.
one attempt to reduce the emissions of compression ignition engines has been the use of aftertreatment systems to alter or remove the unwanted emissions from the exhaust of the engines. one form of aftertreatment technology that has shown promise in reducing the nox emissions of compression ignition engines is nox adsorber technology, a catalyst technology. however, the successful implementation of nox adsorber technology has proven difficult. first, for sufficient nox reduction at low temperatures, nox adsorbers must have very high loadings of expensive noble metals. in fact, nox adsorbers that operate successfully in low temperature conditions may require as much as twice the noble metal content of nox adsorbers that only operate in higher temperature conditions. second, the effectiveness of nox adsorber technology in very low temperature conditions is questionable. to improve performance in these conditions, expensive and fuel intensive thermal management may be necessary. third, the catalyst of a nox adsorber is poisoned by sulfur, even at the current ultra low sulfur levels in fuel. this poisoning process reduces the overall lifespan of the catalyst.
another attempt to reduce the emissions of compression ignition engines has been the use of homogeneous charge compression ignition (hcci) combustion. engines that operate in hcci mode have generated much interest due to the potential to operate at high fuel efficiency while generating low combustion emissions. hcci engines differ from conventional diesel compression ignition engines in that diesel engines ignite fuel that is rich, i.e., highly concentrated, in an area in a combustion chamber, while hcci techniques create a dispersed homogeneous fuel/air mixture by the time of combustion. combustion of a homogeneous fuel/air mixture allows an engine to operate such that emission by-products are significantly reduced. however, successful implementation of hcci combustion at all engine load conditions has proven difficult. in high engine load conditions, hcci combustion causes high mechanical loading of engine parts due to a higher peak cylinder pressure than traditional diesel combustion. engine components having commonly used material compositions may not be able to withstand these higher pressures. also, in order to control the timing of hcci combustion in higher load conditions, significant structural changes may need to be made to the engine, including, for example, mechanisms for varying the compression ratio of the engine. one strategy for utilizing hcci combustion is disclosed in u.s. pat. no. 6,561,157, issued to zur loye et al. on 13 may 2003. in the '157 patent, pccl combustion, similar to hcci combustion, is used during some portions of an engine's operation, and other combustion modes, such as standard diesel mode, spark ignited mode, and homogeneous charge duel fuel transition mode, are used during other portions of the engine's operation.

internal combustion engines are used extensively for a variety of purposes. the transportation infrastructure relies almost exclusively on the use of engines to provide power for mobility. electrical power generation also relies heavily on internal combustion engines.
the prolific use of engines in our society has created a number of issues, one of which is the ever-increasing amounts of combustion by-products being emitted. although today's engines operate with much lower emission levels than previous generations of engines, the rapidly increasing numbers of engines being used creates the need to reduce emission levels even more.
governments around the world recognize this problem and are taking regulatory steps to address the emission levels of engines. for example, levels of oxides of nitrogen (nox), hydrocarbons (hc), carbon monoxide (co), and smoke, among others, must be reduced drastically to meet evolving government standards.
spark ignition engines, by the nature of their operation and the types of fuel used, tend to produce low levels of nox and particulate emissions. compression ignition engines, for example diesel engines, generally produce higher levels of nox and particulate emissions. diesel engines, however, are still popular in use because they provide higher thermal efficiency than their spark-ignition counterparts, and thus offer higher power output for work applications.
one attempt to reduce the emissions of compression ignition engines has been the use of aftertreatment systems to alter or remove the unwanted emissions from the exhaust of the engines. one form of aftertreatment technology that has shown promise in reducing the nox emissions of compression ignition engines is nox adsorber technology, a catalyst technology. however, the successful implementation of nox adsorber technology has proven difficult. first, for sufficient nox reduction at low temperatures, nox adsorbers must have very high loadings of expensive noble metals. in fact, nox adsorbers that operate successfully in low temperature conditions may require as much as twice the noble metal content of nox adsorbers that only operate in higher temperature conditions. second, the effectiveness of nox adsorber technology in very low temperature conditions is questionable. to improve performance in these conditions, expensive and fuel intensive thermal management may be necessary. third, the catalyst of a nox adsorber is poisoned by sulfur, even at the current ultra low sulfur levels in fuel. this poisoning process reduces the overall lifespan of the catalyst.
another attempt to reduce the emissions of compression ignition engines has been the use of homogeneous charge compression ignition (hcci) combustion. engines that operate in hcci mode have generated much interest due to the potential to operate at high fuel efficiency while generating low combustion emissions. hcci engines differ from conventional diesel compression ignition engines in that diesel engines ignite fuel that is rich, i.e., highly concentrated, in an area in a combustion chamber, while hcci techniques create a dispersed homogeneous fuel/air mixture by the time of combustion. combustion of a homogeneous fuel/air mixture allows an engine to operate such that emission by-products are significantly reduced. however, successful implementation of hcci combustion at all engine load conditions has proven difficult. in high engine load conditions, hcci combustion causes high mechanical loading of engine parts due to a higher peak cylinder pressure than traditional diesel combustion. engine components having commonly used material compositions may not be able to withstand these higher pressures. also, in order to control the timing of hcci combustion in higher load conditions, significant structural changes may need to be made to the engine, including, for example, mechanisms for varying the compression ratio of the engine. one strategy for utilizing hcci combustion is disclosed in u.s. pat. no. 6,561,157, issued to zur loye et al. on 13 may 2003. in the '157 patent, pccl combustion, similar to hcci combustion, is used during some portions of an engine's operation, and other combustion modes, such as standard diesel mode, spark ignited mode, and homogeneous charge duel fuel transition mode, are used during other portions of the engine's operation.

in another embodiment of the present invention, a method of operating an internal combustion engine comprises operating the engine in a first combustion mode. the method also includes switching operation of the engine to a second combustion mode. the method includes directing an exhaust stream of the engine into contact with a nox adsorber during any combustion mode other than the first combustion mode.
in yet another embodiment of the present invention, a method of operating an internal combustion engine comprises causing an exhaust stream of an engine, where the engine is capable of selectively operating in an hcci combustion mode and at least one other combustion mode, to contact a nox adsorber substantially only during the at least one other combustion mode.

various methods for nitrogen oxide (nox) regeneration and sulfur regeneration of a nitrogen oxide store are conventional. for example, german published patent application no. 197 50 226 describes a method for nox regeneration in which a desired, rich exhaust gas composition is generated substantially only by engine measures, including suitable control of exhaust gas recycling.
it is an object of the present invention to provide a new type of exhaust gas cleaning unit and a corresponding operating method for this unit.
in a method for operating an exhaust-gas cleaning unit of a diesel engine including a particle filter and a nitrogen oxide storage device arranged upstream of the particle filter, wherein sulfur regeneration of the nitrogen oxide storage device is performed periodically at raised exhaust gas temperatures and, in certain phases, with a rich exhaust gas composition, and also soot regeneration of the particle filter is performed at raised exhaust gas temperatures with a lean exhaust gas composition, at least some of the sulfur regeneration and the soot regeneration phases are performed in a combined soot and sulfur regeneration phase, and for the sulfur regeneration, at least temporarily, a rich exhaust-gas composition with a temperature higher than the temperature of the lean exhaust gas composition is provided for the soot regeneration of the particle filter.
the exhaust gas cleaning unit of a diesel engine includes a nitrogen oxide store connected upstream of the particle filter. connecting the nitrogen oxide store upstream of the particle filter, as seen in the direction of flow of the exhaust gas, has a number of particular advantages. for example, nitrogen oxides, which have been temporarily stored in the nitrogen oxide store, may be liberated at the elevated exhaust gas temperature which is required for soot regeneration of the particle filter and may additionally assist the soot regeneration in the form of nitrogen dioxide (no2). furthermore, sulfur regeneration of the nitrogen oxide store, which requires relatively high exhaust gas temperatures of typically between 600Â° c. and 700Â° c., may be combined with soot regeneration of the particle filter, for which elevated exhaust gas temperatures of between approximately 400Â° c. and approximately 600Â° c. are generally used, the fact that the nitrogen oxide store is connected upstream of the particle filter resulting in a natural temperature gradient along the exhaust gas flow which matches these temperature requirements.
a respective oxidation catalytic converter may be provided upstream of the nitrogen oxide store, between the nitrogen oxide store and the particle filter and/or downstream of the particle filter. depending on the particular arrangement, an oxidation catalytic converter of this type assists with raising the exhaust gas temperature, soot regeneration by generating no2 and/or avoiding hydrocarbon (hc) and/or carbon monoxide (co) emissions.
an hc/co/o2 storage coating and/or an oxidation catalyst coating and/or a coating which promotes the oxidation of soot may be provided in the particle filter, preferably in each case in an inlet-side part thereof. thus, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide may be trapped or oxidized and/or the soot burn-off during the particle filter regeneration may be assisted.
an exhaust gas according to the present invention may include a lambda probe downstream of the particle filter. this probe may be used to monitor the soot burn-off behavior during the particle regeneration and to detect any breakthrough of reducing agents during the nox regeneration of the nitrogen oxide store.
the operating method according to the present invention includes firstly sulfur regeneration phases for the nitrogen oxide store, which are performed for a longer period than the nox regeneration phases, in order to achieve complete sulfur desorption. moreover, combined sulfur and soot regeneration phases are provided, during which the sulfur regeneration of the nitrogen oxide store and the soot regeneration of the particle filter may be linked in terms of time by the two regeneration operations being performed immediately after one another or by one regeneration operation being performed intermittently at intervals during the other regeneration operation. in this manner, the thermal exhaust gas energy may be utilized for both regeneration processes.
in the operating method according to the present invention, a lambda probe downstream of the particle filter may be used firstly to detect the progress of a soot regeneration phase and secondly to detect a breakthrough of reducing agents during a nitrogen oxide regeneration phase and therefore that the latter phase has ended.",5,problem,carbon monoxide emissions,1.0,partial,-1

1. field of the invention
the present invention relates to an nox purifying catalyst that removes nox in exhaust gas with sufficient efficiency from, for example, automobiles, and in particular relates to an nox purifying catalyst that removes nox with sufficient efficiency even under low temperature operation such as diesel engine automobiles.
2. related art
an nox purifying catalyst that is capable of reducing nox in the exhaust gas discharged from automobiles and the like efficiently has been investigated. most importantly, in diesel engine automobiles, the reduction of nox has been a major challenge, as well as the reduction of pm (particulate material).
generally, in diesel engine automobiles, an oxidation catalyst (doc) and a diesel particulate filter (dpf) are provided in the exhaust path of the diesel engine. however, a combination of the conventional doc and dpf are insufficient if a further reduction of nox is required in the future.
an example of the process for further reducing nox in the exhaust gas includes an exhaust purifying device for internal combustion engines using an nox absorbent disclosed in japanese patent no. 2600492. the nox absorbent absorbs nox while the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is lean and release the absorbed nox when the oxygen concentration of the exhaust gas is lowered. therefore the exhaust purifying device releases the nox absorbed while the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is lean from the nox absorbent when the oxygen concentration of the exhaust gas is lowered.
however, alkali metals, alkali earth metals and the like are used in nox absorbents employed in the exhaust purifying device as disclosed in japanese patent no. 2600492. in addition, a noble metal such as platinum is used for the oxidation of co, hc, and nox under lean conditions and for the reduction of nox under rich conditions. according to japanese patent no. 2600492, the use of strongly basic materials as the nox absorbent of the device causes a problem in that the noble metal is readily deactivated and nox purifying performance is deteriorated, particularly in low temperature operation.
in addition, the use of the strongly basic materials as an nox absorbent makes binding with sox, which has higher acidity than nox, stronger. therefore, a problem arises in that regeneration after sulfur-poisoning requires a higher temperature, which makes low temperature catalyst regeneration more difficult.
in other words, the device according to japanese patent no. 2600492 produces the desired effect when applied to gasoline engines operated primarily under high temperature conditions; however, its nox reduction effect is insufficient when applied to diesel engines and the like operated primarily, for example, 300Â° c. or less.
the present invention was accomplished in view of the foregoing problems. an object of the present invention is to provide an nox purifying catalyst that removes nox with sufficient efficiency, even in low temperature operation such as that of diesel engine automobiles.
the present inventors discovered that nox reducing performance in low temperature operation was improved by combining a first catalytic layer including zeolite-based catalyst having iron and/or cerium elements, and a second catalytic layer including a noble metal and cerium oxide-based material, and by coating so that the first catalytic layer is the uppermost layer. accordingly, the present invention was accomplished. more specifically, the present invention provides the following.
according to a first aspect of the present invention, an nox purifying catalyst for purifying nox in exhaust gas discharged from an internal combustion engine with air-fuel ratios controlled to lean or rich, includes a first catalytic layer and a second catalytic layer. the first catalytic layer includes a Î²-zeolite having at least one element selected from the group consisting of iron and cerium elements, and the second catalytic layer includes a noble metal and cerium oxide-based material. the second and first catalytic layers are coated on a support in that order, so that the first catalytic layer is the uppermost layer. nox passing through the first catalytic layer and is oxidized and adsorbed on the second catalytic layer in the lean condition, nox adsorbed on the second catalytic layer is converted to nh3 by the reaction with a reductant on the second catalytic layer, the nh3 is then transferred to and adsorbed on the first catalytic layer in the rich region, and then the nh3 reacts with nox to be converted to nitrogen and water.
the nox purifying catalyst according to the first aspect of the present invention removes nox with sufficient efficiency as follows. in the condition where the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is set to lean, nox in the exhaust gas easily diffuses through the upper first catalytic layer, a solid acid catalyst, and reaches the lower second catalytic layer. the nox contacts the second catalytic layer, and is temporarily adsorbed on the second catalytic layer (hereinafter referred to as ?œtemporary storage?? while being oxidized by a noble metal such as platinum in the second catalytic layer. the noble metal such as platinum acts as a catalytic active species that oxidizes nox (for example, from no to no2).
next, the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is set to rich. nox adsorbed on the second catalytic layer is converted to ammonia by reaction with the hydrogen generated from a water gas shift reaction, and ammonia diffuses to and is adsorbed on the first catalytic layer (hereinafter referred to as ?œre-storage??. the re-storage can be achieved easily as the first and the second catalytic layers are coated to be adjacent.
after that, when the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is set back to lean, the ammonia adsorbed on the first catalytic layer and nox in the exhaust gas are converted to nitrogen and water via ammonia-selective catalytic reduction, and the nitrogen thus produced is released from the surface of the first catalytic layer. as the first catalytic layer is the uppermost layer, the nitrogen produced by the reduction is efficiently released from the uppermost face. at the same time, the temporary storage also undergoes simultaneously.
as described above, by repeating a lean/rich control of the exhaust gas at a predetermined cycle, the catalyst stores nox temporarily in the second catalytic layer and converts ammonia re-stored in the first catalytic layer into nitrogen and water, and releases them in the lean condition. on the other hand, the catalyst converts nox stored temporarily to ammonia, and re-stores it in the first catalytic layer in the rich condition. thus, the catalyst is capable of reducing nox continuously. nox removal performance is improved as a cycle of the temporary storage of nox, the conversion to ammonia, the re-storage of ammonia, the reduction to nitrogen and the release thereof occurs efficiently by producing the multiple layers with a configuration, in which the uppermost layer is the first catalytic layer and the lower layer is the second catalytic layer. the aforementioned function is to be hereinafter described in the embodiments of the present invention in greater detail.
in addition, the solid acid catalyst of the first catalytic layer of the present invention is a Î²-zeolite. the Î²-zeolite is preferably applied to the present invention because of being nox-permeable and having high ammonia absorption capacity, as well as relatively high heat-resistance. in the present invention, the ion-exchanged zeolite-based catalyst with a transition metal such as fe and ce is utilized, as described below.
moreover, in the present invention, the first catalytic layer is a Î²-zeolite further including iron and/or cerium elements. as a result, the purification performance, particularly nox removal performance, is improved. more specifically, it is expected that the iron element adsorbs nox and the reductant, and the cerium element adsorbs nox as well as suppressing poisoning of the catalyst by the reductant because of its storage and release ability of oxygen.
the nox purifying catalyst of the present invention does not ?œabsorb??nox as the nox absorbent of japanese patent no. 2600492 incorporates nox, but ?œadsorbs??it via a two-step process including the temporary storage and re-storage. additionally, the catalyst is free from strongly basic materials such as alkali- or alkali earth metals. an unconventional beneficial effect of the present invention is that the nox purifying catalyst of the present invention removes nox with sufficient efficiency, even in low temperature operation primarily at 300Â° c. or less such as in diesel engine automobiles, without suffering from deactivation of the noble metal catalyst at low temperature.
the lean condition herein indicates the condition in which the air-fuel ratio (a/f ratio) is high (i.e., the condition in which the fuel concentration is low), and the rich condition herein indicates the condition in which the air-fuel ratio (a/f ratio) is low (i.e., the condition in which the fuel concentration is high).
according to a second aspect of the nox purifying catalyst of the first aspect of the present invention, the reductant is at least one selected from the group consisting of co and hc of the exhaust gas, and hydrogen generated from at least one of the co and hc components contacting with the second catalytic layer.
as described above, in the present invention, nox adsorbed on the second catalytic layer is converted to nh3 with a reductant on the second catalytic layer. according to the second aspect of the present invention, the nox adsorbed on the second catalytic layer is converted to nh3 efficiently by the use of the aforementioned reductant in the exhaust gas.
according to a third aspect of the present invention, the nox purifying catalyst according to the first or second aspect of the present invention, the second catalytic layer further includes heat-resistant inorganic oxide.
in the third aspect of the present invention, the heat-resistant inorganic oxide included in the second catalytic layer enhances the efficiency of the water gas shift reaction at temperatures of 300Â° c. or more. as a result, the conversion of nox to ammonia under rich conditions can be achieved more efficiently.
the noble metal, the catalytic active species used, is supported on the heat-resistant inorganic oxide. the heat-resistant inorganic oxide can be widely selected from inorganic oxides such as zirconium oxide-based materials, alumina-based materials, zeolite-based materials, and silica-based materials, in addition to the aforementioned cerium oxide-based material. the noble metal can be supported entirely on the heat-resistant inorganic oxide that includes the second catalytic layer and can be supported on the particular inorganic oxide.
according to a fourth aspect of the present invention, in the nox purifying catalyst according to the third aspect of the present invention, the heat-resistant inorganic oxide is at least one selected from the group consisting of zirconium oxide-based materials, alumina-based materials, zeolite-based materials, and silica-based materials.
according to fifth aspect of the present invention, in the nox purifying catalyst according to the fourth aspect of the present invention, the zirconium oxide-based material is at least one selected from the group consisting of zirconium oxide, and a composite oxide of zirconium and a rare earth element.
according to a sixth aspect of the present invention, in the nox purifying catalyst according to the any one of the first to fifth aspects of the present invention, the cerium oxide-based material in the second catalytic layer is at least one selected from the group consisting of cerium oxide, and a composite oxide of cerium and a rare earth element.
in the fifth aspect of the present invention, by the use of zirconium oxide and/or composite oxide of zirconium and rare earth elements, preferably the composite oxide, the second catalytic layer facilitates the generation of hydrogen as a water gas shift catalyst to promote the formation of ammonia in the second catalytic layer. in the sixth aspect of the present invention, by the use of cerium oxide and/or a composite oxide of cerium and rare earth elements, preferably cerium oxide and the composite oxide, the adsorption of nox to the second catalytic layer is facilitated. preferred rare earth elements are at least one rare earth element selected from the group consisting of praseodymium (pr), lanthanum (la), and neodymium (nd).
according to a seventh aspect of the present invention, in the nox purifying catalyst according to the any one of the first to sixth aspects of the present invention, the content of the noble metal decreases gradually or stepwise along the direction from the first catalytic layer to the support.
in the seventh aspect of the present invention, the formation of ammonia by way of the water gas shift reaction is predominant in the upper region (closer to the uppermost face) of the second catalytic layer because the noble metal content is high. on the other hand, the temporary storage of nox is predominant in the lower region (closer to the support) because the noble metal content is low or no noble metal exists in this region. as a result, nox reducing efficiency is further improved.
the composition of the second catalytic layer, in which the content of the noble metal decreases gradually or stepwise along the direction from the first catalytic layer to the support, is not particularly limited. however, the content of the noble metal may decrease gradually along the thickness direction, or the second catalytic layer may be composed of multiple layers, in which the content of the noble metal in each layer decreases stepwise. an aspect of the present invention also encompasses the second catalytic layer including a layer containing substantially no noble metal at the side of the support.",1,problem,nox reduction,1.0,exact,0

an example of the process for further reducing nox in the exhaust gas includes an exhaust purifying device for internal combustion engines using an nox absorbent disclosed in japanese patent no. 2600492. the nox absorbent absorbs nox while the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is lean and release the absorbed nox when the oxygen concentration of the exhaust gas is lowered. therefore the exhaust purifying device releases the nox absorbed while the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is lean from the nox absorbent when the oxygen concentration of the exhaust gas is lowered.
however, alkali metals, alkali earth metals and the like are used in nox absorbents employed in the exhaust purifying device as disclosed in japanese patent no. 2600492. in addition, a noble metal such as platinum is used for the oxidation of co, hc, and nox under lean conditions and for the reduction of nox under rich conditions. according to japanese patent no. 2600492, the use of strongly basic materials as the nox absorbent of the device causes a problem in that the noble metal is readily deactivated and nox purifying performance is deteriorated, particularly in low temperature operation.
in addition, the use of the strongly basic materials as an nox absorbent makes binding with sox, which has higher acidity than nox, stronger. therefore, a problem arises in that regeneration after sulfur-poisoning requires a higher temperature, which makes low temperature catalyst regeneration more difficult.
in other words, the device according to japanese patent no. 2600492 produces the desired effect when applied to gasoline engines operated primarily under high temperature conditions; however, its nox reduction effect is insufficient when applied to diesel engines and the like operated primarily, for example, 300Â° c. or less.
the present invention was accomplished in view of the foregoing problems. an object of the present invention is to provide an nox purifying catalyst that removes nox with sufficient efficiency, even in low temperature operation such as that of diesel engine automobiles.
the present inventors discovered that nox reducing performance in low temperature operation was improved by combining a first catalytic layer including zeolite-based catalyst having iron and/or cerium elements, and a second catalytic layer including a noble metal and cerium oxide-based material, and by coating so that the first catalytic layer is the uppermost layer. accordingly, the present invention was accomplished. more specifically, the present invention provides the following.
according to a first aspect of the present invention, an nox purifying catalyst for purifying nox in exhaust gas discharged from an internal combustion engine with air-fuel ratios controlled to lean or rich, includes a first catalytic layer and a second catalytic layer. the first catalytic layer includes a Î²-zeolite having at least one element selected from the group consisting of iron and cerium elements, and the second catalytic layer includes a noble metal and cerium oxide-based material. the second and first catalytic layers are coated on a support in that order, so that the first catalytic layer is the uppermost layer. nox passing through the first catalytic layer and is oxidized and adsorbed on the second catalytic layer in the lean condition, nox adsorbed on the second catalytic layer is converted to nh3 by the reaction with a reductant on the second catalytic layer, the nh3 is then transferred to and adsorbed on the first catalytic layer in the rich region, and then the nh3 reacts with nox to be converted to nitrogen and water.
the nox purifying catalyst according to the first aspect of the present invention removes nox with sufficient efficiency as follows. in the condition where the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is set to lean, nox in the exhaust gas easily diffuses through the upper first catalytic layer, a solid acid catalyst, and reaches the lower second catalytic layer. the nox contacts the second catalytic layer, and is temporarily adsorbed on the second catalytic layer (hereinafter referred to as ?œtemporary storage?? while being oxidized by a noble metal such as platinum in the second catalytic layer. the noble metal such as platinum acts as a catalytic active species that oxidizes nox (for example, from no to no2).
next, the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is set to rich. nox adsorbed on the second catalytic layer is converted to ammonia by reaction with the hydrogen generated from a water gas shift reaction, and ammonia diffuses to and is adsorbed on the first catalytic layer (hereinafter referred to as ?œre-storage??. the re-storage can be achieved easily as the first and the second catalytic layers are coated to be adjacent.
after that, when the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is set back to lean, the ammonia adsorbed on the first catalytic layer and nox in the exhaust gas are converted to nitrogen and water via ammonia-selective catalytic reduction, and the nitrogen thus produced is released from the surface of the first catalytic layer. as the first catalytic layer is the uppermost layer, the nitrogen produced by the reduction is efficiently released from the uppermost face. at the same time, the temporary storage also undergoes simultaneously.
as described above, by repeating a lean/rich control of the exhaust gas at a predetermined cycle, the catalyst stores nox temporarily in the second catalytic layer and converts ammonia re-stored in the first catalytic layer into nitrogen and water, and releases them in the lean condition. on the other hand, the catalyst converts nox stored temporarily to ammonia, and re-stores it in the first catalytic layer in the rich condition. thus, the catalyst is capable of reducing nox continuously. nox removal performance is improved as a cycle of the temporary storage of nox, the conversion to ammonia, the re-storage of ammonia, the reduction to nitrogen and the release thereof occurs efficiently by producing the multiple layers with a configuration, in which the uppermost layer is the first catalytic layer and the lower layer is the second catalytic layer. the aforementioned function is to be hereinafter described in the embodiments of the present invention in greater detail.
in addition, the solid acid catalyst of the first catalytic layer of the present invention is a Î²-zeolite. the Î²-zeolite is preferably applied to the present invention because of being nox-permeable and having high ammonia absorption capacity, as well as relatively high heat-resistance. in the present invention, the ion-exchanged zeolite-based catalyst with a transition metal such as fe and ce is utilized, as described below.
moreover, in the present invention, the first catalytic layer is a Î²-zeolite further including iron and/or cerium elements. as a result, the purification performance, particularly nox removal performance, is improved. more specifically, it is expected that the iron element adsorbs nox and the reductant, and the cerium element adsorbs nox as well as suppressing poisoning of the catalyst by the reductant because of its storage and release ability of oxygen.
the nox purifying catalyst of the present invention does not ?œabsorb??nox as the nox absorbent of japanese patent no. 2600492 incorporates nox, but ?œadsorbs??it via a two-step process including the temporary storage and re-storage. additionally, the catalyst is free from strongly basic materials such as alkali- or alkali earth metals. an unconventional beneficial effect of the present invention is that the nox purifying catalyst of the present invention removes nox with sufficient efficiency, even in low temperature operation primarily at 300Â° c. or less such as in diesel engine automobiles, without suffering from deactivation of the noble metal catalyst at low temperature.
the lean condition herein indicates the condition in which the air-fuel ratio (a/f ratio) is high (i.e., the condition in which the fuel concentration is low), and the rich condition herein indicates the condition in which the air-fuel ratio (a/f ratio) is low (i.e., the condition in which the fuel concentration is high).
according to a second aspect of the nox purifying catalyst of the first aspect of the present invention, the reductant is at least one selected from the group consisting of co and hc of the exhaust gas, and hydrogen generated from at least one of the co and hc components contacting with the second catalytic layer.
as described above, in the present invention, nox adsorbed on the second catalytic layer is converted to nh3 with a reductant on the second catalytic layer. according to the second aspect of the present invention, the nox adsorbed on the second catalytic layer is converted to nh3 efficiently by the use of the aforementioned reductant in the exhaust gas.
according to a third aspect of the present invention, the nox purifying catalyst according to the first or second aspect of the present invention, the second catalytic layer further includes heat-resistant inorganic oxide.
in the third aspect of the present invention, the heat-resistant inorganic oxide included in the second catalytic layer enhances the efficiency of the water gas shift reaction at temperatures of 300Â° c. or more. as a result, the conversion of nox to ammonia under rich conditions can be achieved more efficiently.
the noble metal, the catalytic active species used, is supported on the heat-resistant inorganic oxide. the heat-resistant inorganic oxide can be widely selected from inorganic oxides such as zirconium oxide-based materials, alumina-based materials, zeolite-based materials, and silica-based materials, in addition to the aforementioned cerium oxide-based material. the noble metal can be supported entirely on the heat-resistant inorganic oxide that includes the second catalytic layer and can be supported on the particular inorganic oxide.
according to a fourth aspect of the present invention, in the nox purifying catalyst according to the third aspect of the present invention, the heat-resistant inorganic oxide is at least one selected from the group consisting of zirconium oxide-based materials, alumina-based materials, zeolite-based materials, and silica-based materials.
according to fifth aspect of the present invention, in the nox purifying catalyst according to the fourth aspect of the present invention, the zirconium oxide-based material is at least one selected from the group consisting of zirconium oxide, and a composite oxide of zirconium and a rare earth element.
according to a sixth aspect of the present invention, in the nox purifying catalyst according to the any one of the first to fifth aspects of the present invention, the cerium oxide-based material in the second catalytic layer is at least one selected from the group consisting of cerium oxide, and a composite oxide of cerium and a rare earth element.
in the fifth aspect of the present invention, by the use of zirconium oxide and/or composite oxide of zirconium and rare earth elements, preferably the composite oxide, the second catalytic layer facilitates the generation of hydrogen as a water gas shift catalyst to promote the formation of ammonia in the second catalytic layer. in the sixth aspect of the present invention, by the use of cerium oxide and/or a composite oxide of cerium and rare earth elements, preferably cerium oxide and the composite oxide, the adsorption of nox to the second catalytic layer is facilitated. preferred rare earth elements are at least one rare earth element selected from the group consisting of praseodymium (pr), lanthanum (la), and neodymium (nd).
according to a seventh aspect of the present invention, in the nox purifying catalyst according to the any one of the first to sixth aspects of the present invention, the content of the noble metal decreases gradually or stepwise along the direction from the first catalytic layer to the support.
in the seventh aspect of the present invention, the formation of ammonia by way of the water gas shift reaction is predominant in the upper region (closer to the uppermost face) of the second catalytic layer because the noble metal content is high. on the other hand, the temporary storage of nox is predominant in the lower region (closer to the support) because the noble metal content is low or no noble metal exists in this region. as a result, nox reducing efficiency is further improved.
the composition of the second catalytic layer, in which the content of the noble metal decreases gradually or stepwise along the direction from the first catalytic layer to the support, is not particularly limited. however, the content of the noble metal may decrease gradually along the thickness direction, or the second catalytic layer may be composed of multiple layers, in which the content of the noble metal in each layer decreases stepwise. an aspect of the present invention also encompasses the second catalytic layer including a layer containing substantially no noble metal at the side of the support.",3,problem,deactivation of the noble metal catalyst,1.0,exact,0

according to a third aspect of the present invention, the nox purifying catalyst according to the first or second aspect of the present invention, the second catalytic layer further includes heat-resistant inorganic oxide.
in the third aspect of the present invention, the heat-resistant inorganic oxide included in the second catalytic layer enhances the efficiency of the water gas shift reaction at temperatures of 300Â° c. or more. as a result, the conversion of nox to ammonia under rich conditions can be achieved more efficiently.
the noble metal, the catalytic active species used, is supported on the heat-resistant inorganic oxide. the heat-resistant inorganic oxide can be widely selected from inorganic oxides such as zirconium oxide-based materials, alumina-based materials, zeolite-based materials, and silica-based materials, in addition to the aforementioned cerium oxide-based material. the noble metal can be supported entirely on the heat-resistant inorganic oxide that includes the second catalytic layer and can be supported on the particular inorganic oxide.
according to a fourth aspect of the present invention, in the nox purifying catalyst according to the third aspect of the present invention, the heat-resistant inorganic oxide is at least one selected from the group consisting of zirconium oxide-based materials, alumina-based materials, zeolite-based materials, and silica-based materials.
according to fifth aspect of the present invention, in the nox purifying catalyst according to the fourth aspect of the present invention, the zirconium oxide-based material is at least one selected from the group consisting of zirconium oxide, and a composite oxide of zirconium and a rare earth element.
according to a sixth aspect of the present invention, in the nox purifying catalyst according to the any one of the first to fifth aspects of the present invention, the cerium oxide-based material in the second catalytic layer is at least one selected from the group consisting of cerium oxide, and a composite oxide of cerium and a rare earth element.
in the fifth aspect of the present invention, by the use of zirconium oxide and/or composite oxide of zirconium and rare earth elements, preferably the composite oxide, the second catalytic layer facilitates the generation of hydrogen as a water gas shift catalyst to promote the formation of ammonia in the second catalytic layer. in the sixth aspect of the present invention, by the use of cerium oxide and/or a composite oxide of cerium and rare earth elements, preferably cerium oxide and the composite oxide, the adsorption of nox to the second catalytic layer is facilitated. preferred rare earth elements are at least one rare earth element selected from the group consisting of praseodymium (pr), lanthanum (la), and neodymium (nd).
according to a seventh aspect of the present invention, in the nox purifying catalyst according to the any one of the first to sixth aspects of the present invention, the content of the noble metal decreases gradually or stepwise along the direction from the first catalytic layer to the support.
in the seventh aspect of the present invention, the formation of ammonia by way of the water gas shift reaction is predominant in the upper region (closer to the uppermost face) of the second catalytic layer because the noble metal content is high. on the other hand, the temporary storage of nox is predominant in the lower region (closer to the support) because the noble metal content is low or no noble metal exists in this region. as a result, nox reducing efficiency is further improved.
the composition of the second catalytic layer, in which the content of the noble metal decreases gradually or stepwise along the direction from the first catalytic layer to the support, is not particularly limited. however, the content of the noble metal may decrease gradually along the thickness direction, or the second catalytic layer may be composed of multiple layers, in which the content of the noble metal in each layer decreases stepwise. an aspect of the present invention also encompasses the second catalytic layer including a layer containing substantially no noble metal at the side of the support.",5,problem,insufficient nox reduction effect,1.0,partial,0

us 2005/0031514 a1 describes the application of diesel particle filters which are coated with an scr catalyst. here too, the iron is present in ion-exchanged form, which leads to the abovementioned disadvantages.
ep 1 475 149 a1 discloses a catalyst for the reduction of no to n2 by means of hydrogen under o2-rich conditions. this known catalyst is based on platinum which is distributed in an amount of from 0.1 to 2 per cent by weight on a support material comprising magnesium oxide or cerium oxide or a precursor thereof. although quite good results are obtained in the reduction of nox using this catalyst, this catalyst, too, could reach its limits in the case of future pollutant limit values. in addition, an in-principle problem with the presence of hydrogen over platinum-containing catalysts is that no is also converted into the undesirable greenhouse gas n2o, also known as laughing gas.
a process for removing nitrogen oxides from an offgas stream is described in ep 0 666 099 b1. the catalyst used here adsorbs the nitrogen oxides present in the offgas, after which a gas having a particular content of a reducing substance is supplied to the catalyst at prescribed time intervals and for particular periods of time. however, such storage catalysts in which basic components such as lithium oxide, potassium oxide, sodium oxide, barium oxide or similar oxides are used require relatively complicated control and usually have a high regeneration requirement.
in the case of these nox storage catalysts, the no which is mainly emitted is oxidized over a catalyst comprising platinum to no2 which is subsequently adsorbed on specific storage media, for example baco3. when the storage capacity of this catalyst is exhausted, a engine-induced regeneration of the catalyst in which the nitrogen oxides introduced are converted into nitrogen is commenced.
a further disadvantage of the known nox storage catalysts is the risk of poisoning of the nox sorbents by the sulphur oxides so2 and so3 present in the offgas. to overcome these problems, complicated engine management strategies are usually necessary.
ep 0 960 649 b1 discloses an offgas purification catalyst in which the materials used comprise cerium oxide and/or zirconium dioxide mixed oxides which serve to remove saturated hydrocarbons from the offgas. ammonia is used as reducing agent for the nitrogen oxides present in the offgas.
however, the active component v2o5 frequently used in such scr catalysts is associated with toxicological concerns and can also melt or sublime at very high offgas temperatures (>650Â° c.).
a further disadvantage of the known solutions for the removal of nox from o2-rich exhaust gases is in most cases that the nitrogen oxides are reacted effectively only above 200Â° c. since the temperature of the exhaust gases is steadily being reduced as a result of the continual optimization of the efficiency of internal combustion engines, the known solutions are associated with a great problem in terms of their effectiveness. for example, in the case of modern internal combustion engines operating according to the diesel principle for passenger cars, the exhaust gas temperature in the relevant certification cycle is below 150Â° c. for about 60% of the time and below 200Â° c. for about 75% of the time.
it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing an scr catalyst for the selective reduction of nox in nox-containing exhaust gases of internal combustion engines using the reducing agent ammonia. a further object of the invention is to provide a catalyst for use in a selective reduction of nox in nox-containing exhaust gases of internal combustion engines which consists exclusively of one or more toxicologically acceptable substances and can effectively reduce nitrogen oxides even at low temperatures of less than 200Â° c.
according to the invention, a catalyst for selectively reducing nox in an exhaust gas stream is produced by applying an iron salt solution to a support layer on a substrate body. the amount of iron salt in the solution is selected such that no excess iron salt is present after impregnation of the support layer with the solution.
in the process of the invention, a defined amount of iron salt is dissolved in a known amount of liquid and the resulting solution is applied to the support layer so that after this impregnation of the support layer there is no excess of iron salt solution present. instead, there is a precisely determined and fixed amount of the solution and thus of iron, so that exactly the same amount of iron is applied to the support layer in each impregnation. in this way, reproducible catalysts having constant good properties can be produced even in mass production.
a further advantage of the process of the invention is that no liquid remains on the support material after impregnation of the latter, so that the filtration and/or washing processes required in processes known from the prior art become unnecessary. after this impregnation, the coated support is calcined in air, resulting in the actual catalytically active component iron oxide being formed from the iron salt.
the use of iron oxide has been found to be particularly advantageous for the effectiveness of the catalyst produced by the process of the invention, since a very much higher proportion of the pollutants can be removed from the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine in this way. compared to systems exchanged with iron ions (e.g. fe-Î²-zeolite), the material containing iron oxide according to the present invention has an at least equal scr activity and a considerably better long-term hydrothermal stability.
in the process, it has been found to be particularly advantageous to use water as liquid. for the support layer, which should have a very high surface area, it is possible to use a zeolite, but possibly also a nanosize, oxidic material.
as regards the effectiveness of the catalyst 1, it has been found to be advantageous to apply such an amount of iron oxide to the support layer that the proportion of iron within the support layer is 0.1-5 per cent by mass.
in a preferred embodiment, the catalyst comprises a substrate body, a support layer applied to the substrate body, an active layer applied to the support layer. the active layer comprises iron oxide and at least one of a promoter.
the inventors have surprisingly found that precisely the promoters tungsten, zirconium and/or molybdenum are able to increase the activity of the catalyst and reduce its hydrothermal ageing. in particular, nitrogen oxides can be reduced effectively by means of the catalyst of the invention even at low temperatures.
in an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the substrate body can be a honeycomb body which is composed of a ceramic material and simultaneously serves as particle filter.
however, the substrate body can, as an alternative, also be formed by a metal substrate.
the invention further relates to an apparatus and process for the selective reduction of nox in nox-containing exhaust gases of internal combustion engines comprising such a catalyst. the introduction of reducing agent into the exhaust gas line in which the catalyst is located makes the reduction of nox possible. the reduction of nox is improved by no2 which is formed by oxidation of no by means of the active component comprising iron oxide which is present in the catalyst.
a process for the selective reduction of nox in nox-containing exhaust gases of internal combustion engines by means of such an apparatus is also provided.

ep 1 475 149 a1 discloses a catalyst for the reduction of no to n2 by means of hydrogen under o2-rich conditions. this known catalyst is based on platinum which is distributed in an amount of from 0.1 to 2 per cent by weight on a support material comprising magnesium oxide or cerium oxide or a precursor thereof. although quite good results are obtained in the reduction of nox using this catalyst, this catalyst, too, could reach its limits in the case of future pollutant limit values. in addition, an in-principle problem with the presence of hydrogen over platinum-containing catalysts is that no is also converted into the undesirable greenhouse gas n2o, also known as laughing gas.
a process for removing nitrogen oxides from an offgas stream is described in ep 0 666 099 b1. the catalyst used here adsorbs the nitrogen oxides present in the offgas, after which a gas having a particular content of a reducing substance is supplied to the catalyst at prescribed time intervals and for particular periods of time. however, such storage catalysts in which basic components such as lithium oxide, potassium oxide, sodium oxide, barium oxide or similar oxides are used require relatively complicated control and usually have a high regeneration requirement.
in the case of these nox storage catalysts, the no which is mainly emitted is oxidized over a catalyst comprising platinum to no2 which is subsequently adsorbed on specific storage media, for example baco3. when the storage capacity of this catalyst is exhausted, a engine-induced regeneration of the catalyst in which the nitrogen oxides introduced are converted into nitrogen is commenced.
a further disadvantage of the known nox storage catalysts is the risk of poisoning of the nox sorbents by the sulphur oxides so2 and so3 present in the offgas. to overcome these problems, complicated engine management strategies are usually necessary.
ep 0 960 649 b1 discloses an offgas purification catalyst in which the materials used comprise cerium oxide and/or zirconium dioxide mixed oxides which serve to remove saturated hydrocarbons from the offgas. ammonia is used as reducing agent for the nitrogen oxides present in the offgas.
however, the active component v2o5 frequently used in such scr catalysts is associated with toxicological concerns and can also melt or sublime at very high offgas temperatures (>650Â° c.).
a further disadvantage of the known solutions for the removal of nox from o2-rich exhaust gases is in most cases that the nitrogen oxides are reacted effectively only above 200Â° c. since the temperature of the exhaust gases is steadily being reduced as a result of the continual optimization of the efficiency of internal combustion engines, the known solutions are associated with a great problem in terms of their effectiveness. for example, in the case of modern internal combustion engines operating according to the diesel principle for passenger cars, the exhaust gas temperature in the relevant certification cycle is below 150Â° c. for about 60% of the time and below 200Â° c. for about 75% of the time.
it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing an scr catalyst for the selective reduction of nox in nox-containing exhaust gases of internal combustion engines using the reducing agent ammonia. a further object of the invention is to provide a catalyst for use in a selective reduction of nox in nox-containing exhaust gases of internal combustion engines which consists exclusively of one or more toxicologically acceptable substances and can effectively reduce nitrogen oxides even at low temperatures of less than 200Â° c.
according to the invention, a catalyst for selectively reducing nox in an exhaust gas stream is produced by applying an iron salt solution to a support layer on a substrate body. the amount of iron salt in the solution is selected such that no excess iron salt is present after impregnation of the support layer with the solution.
in the process of the invention, a defined amount of iron salt is dissolved in a known amount of liquid and the resulting solution is applied to the support layer so that after this impregnation of the support layer there is no excess of iron salt solution present. instead, there is a precisely determined and fixed amount of the solution and thus of iron, so that exactly the same amount of iron is applied to the support layer in each impregnation. in this way, reproducible catalysts having constant good properties can be produced even in mass production.
a further advantage of the process of the invention is that no liquid remains on the support material after impregnation of the latter, so that the filtration and/or washing processes required in processes known from the prior art become unnecessary. after this impregnation, the coated support is calcined in air, resulting in the actual catalytically active component iron oxide being formed from the iron salt.
the use of iron oxide has been found to be particularly advantageous for the effectiveness of the catalyst produced by the process of the invention, since a very much higher proportion of the pollutants can be removed from the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine in this way. compared to systems exchanged with iron ions (e.g. fe-Î²-zeolite), the material containing iron oxide according to the present invention has an at least equal scr activity and a considerably better long-term hydrothermal stability.
in the process, it has been found to be particularly advantageous to use water as liquid. for the support layer, which should have a very high surface area, it is possible to use a zeolite, but possibly also a nanosize, oxidic material.
as regards the effectiveness of the catalyst 1, it has been found to be advantageous to apply such an amount of iron oxide to the support layer that the proportion of iron within the support layer is 0.1-5 per cent by mass.
in a preferred embodiment, the catalyst comprises a substrate body, a support layer applied to the substrate body, an active layer applied to the support layer. the active layer comprises iron oxide and at least one of a promoter.
the inventors have surprisingly found that precisely the promoters tungsten, zirconium and/or molybdenum are able to increase the activity of the catalyst and reduce its hydrothermal ageing. in particular, nitrogen oxides can be reduced effectively by means of the catalyst of the invention even at low temperatures.
in an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the substrate body can be a honeycomb body which is composed of a ceramic material and simultaneously serves as particle filter.
however, the substrate body can, as an alternative, also be formed by a metal substrate.
the invention further relates to an apparatus and process for the selective reduction of nox in nox-containing exhaust gases of internal combustion engines comprising such a catalyst. the introduction of reducing agent into the exhaust gas line in which the catalyst is located makes the reduction of nox possible. the reduction of nox is improved by no2 which is formed by oxidation of no by means of the active component comprising iron oxide which is present in the catalyst.
a process for the selective reduction of nox in nox-containing exhaust gases of internal combustion engines by means of such an apparatus is also provided.

the emission regulations coming into force in the next few years will, in particular, also lead to a tightening of exhaust gas limit values for motor vehicles equipped with diesel engines. from the present-day point of view, a consequence of this is that an after-treatment of the exhaust gas is absolutely necessary for removing nitrogen oxides.

ep 1 475 149 a1 discloses a catalyst for the reduction of no to n2 by means of hydrogen under o2-rich conditions. this known catalyst is based on platinum which is distributed in an amount of from 0.1 to 2 per cent by weight on a support material comprising magnesium oxide or cerium oxide or a precursor thereof. although quite good results are obtained in the reduction of nox using this catalyst, this catalyst, too, could reach its limits in the case of future pollutant limit values. in addition, an in-principle problem with the presence of hydrogen over platinum-containing catalysts is that no is also converted into the undesirable greenhouse gas n2o, also known as laughing gas.
a process for removing nitrogen oxides from an offgas stream is described in ep 0 666 099 b1. the catalyst used here adsorbs the nitrogen oxides present in the offgas, after which a gas having a particular content of a reducing substance is supplied to the catalyst at prescribed time intervals and for particular periods of time. however, such storage catalysts in which basic components such as lithium oxide, potassium oxide, sodium oxide, barium oxide or similar oxides are used require relatively complicated control and usually have a high regeneration requirement.
in the case of these nox storage catalysts, the no which is mainly emitted is oxidized over a catalyst comprising platinum to no2 which is subsequently adsorbed on specific storage media, for example baco3. when the storage capacity of this catalyst is exhausted, a engine-induced regeneration of the catalyst in which the nitrogen oxides introduced are converted into nitrogen is commenced.
a further disadvantage of the known nox storage catalysts is the risk of poisoning of the nox sorbents by the sulphur oxides so2 and so3 present in the offgas. to overcome these problems, complicated engine management strategies are usually necessary.
ep 0 960 649 b1 discloses an offgas purification catalyst in which the materials used comprise cerium oxide and/or zirconium dioxide mixed oxides which serve to remove saturated hydrocarbons from the offgas. ammonia is used as reducing agent for the nitrogen oxides present in the offgas.
however, the active component v2o5 frequently used in such scr catalysts is associated with toxicological concerns and can also melt or sublime at very high offgas temperatures (>650Â° c.).
a further disadvantage of the known solutions for the removal of nox from o2-rich exhaust gases is in most cases that the nitrogen oxides are reacted effectively only above 200Â° c. since the temperature of the exhaust gases is steadily being reduced as a result of the continual optimization of the efficiency of internal combustion engines, the known solutions are associated with a great problem in terms of their effectiveness. for example, in the case of modern internal combustion engines operating according to the diesel principle for passenger cars, the exhaust gas temperature in the relevant certification cycle is below 150Â° c. for about 60% of the time and below 200Â° c. for about 75% of the time.
it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing an scr catalyst for the selective reduction of nox in nox-containing exhaust gases of internal combustion engines using the reducing agent ammonia. a further object of the invention is to provide a catalyst for use in a selective reduction of nox in nox-containing exhaust gases of internal combustion engines which consists exclusively of one or more toxicologically acceptable substances and can effectively reduce nitrogen oxides even at low temperatures of less than 200Â° c.
according to the invention, a catalyst for selectively reducing nox in an exhaust gas stream is produced by applying an iron salt solution to a support layer on a substrate body. the amount of iron salt in the solution is selected such that no excess iron salt is present after impregnation of the support layer with the solution.
in the process of the invention, a defined amount of iron salt is dissolved in a known amount of liquid and the resulting solution is applied to the support layer so that after this impregnation of the support layer there is no excess of iron salt solution present. instead, there is a precisely determined and fixed amount of the solution and thus of iron, so that exactly the same amount of iron is applied to the support layer in each impregnation. in this way, reproducible catalysts having constant good properties can be produced even in mass production.
a further advantage of the process of the invention is that no liquid remains on the support material after impregnation of the latter, so that the filtration and/or washing processes required in processes known from the prior art become unnecessary. after this impregnation, the coated support is calcined in air, resulting in the actual catalytically active component iron oxide being formed from the iron salt.
the use of iron oxide has been found to be particularly advantageous for the effectiveness of the catalyst produced by the process of the invention, since a very much higher proportion of the pollutants can be removed from the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine in this way. compared to systems exchanged with iron ions (e.g. fe-Î²-zeolite), the material containing iron oxide according to the present invention has an at least equal scr activity and a considerably better long-term hydrothermal stability.
in the process, it has been found to be particularly advantageous to use water as liquid. for the support layer, which should have a very high surface area, it is possible to use a zeolite, but possibly also a nanosize, oxidic material.
as regards the effectiveness of the catalyst 1, it has been found to be advantageous to apply such an amount of iron oxide to the support layer that the proportion of iron within the support layer is 0.1-5 per cent by mass.
in a preferred embodiment, the catalyst comprises a substrate body, a support layer applied to the substrate body, an active layer applied to the support layer. the active layer comprises iron oxide and at least one of a promoter.
the inventors have surprisingly found that precisely the promoters tungsten, zirconium and/or molybdenum are able to increase the activity of the catalyst and reduce its hydrothermal ageing. in particular, nitrogen oxides can be reduced effectively by means of the catalyst of the invention even at low temperatures.
in an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the substrate body can be a honeycomb body which is composed of a ceramic material and simultaneously serves as particle filter.
however, the substrate body can, as an alternative, also be formed by a metal substrate.

in the process of the invention, a defined amount of iron salt is dissolved in a known amount of liquid and the resulting solution is applied to the support layer so that after this impregnation of the support layer there is no excess of iron salt solution present. instead, there is a precisely determined and fixed amount of the solution and thus of iron, so that exactly the same amount of iron is applied to the support layer in each impregnation. in this way, reproducible catalysts having constant good properties can be produced even in mass production.
a further advantage of the process of the invention is that no liquid remains on the support material after impregnation of the latter, so that the filtration and/or washing processes required in processes known from the prior art become unnecessary. after this impregnation, the coated support is calcined in air, resulting in the actual catalytically active component iron oxide being formed from the iron salt.
the use of iron oxide has been found to be particularly advantageous for the effectiveness of the catalyst produced by the process of the invention, since a very much higher proportion of the pollutants can be removed from the exhaust gas of an internal combustion engine in this way. compared to systems exchanged with iron ions (e.g. fe-Î²-zeolite), the material containing iron oxide according to the present invention has an at least equal scr activity and a considerably better long-term hydrothermal stability.
in the process, it has been found to be particularly advantageous to use water as liquid. for the support layer, which should have a very high surface area, it is possible to use a zeolite, but possibly also a nanosize, oxidic material.
as regards the effectiveness of the catalyst 1, it has been found to be advantageous to apply such an amount of iron oxide to the support layer that the proportion of iron within the support layer is 0.1-5 per cent by mass.
in a preferred embodiment, the catalyst comprises a substrate body, a support layer applied to the substrate body, an active layer applied to the support layer. the active layer comprises iron oxide and at least one of a promoter.
the inventors have surprisingly found that precisely the promoters tungsten, zirconium and/or molybdenum are able to increase the activity of the catalyst and reduce its hydrothermal ageing. in particular, nitrogen oxides can be reduced effectively by means of the catalyst of the invention even at low temperatures.
in an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the substrate body can be a honeycomb body which is composed of a ceramic material and simultaneously serves as particle filter.
however, the substrate body can, as an alternative, also be formed by a metal substrate.
the invention further relates to an apparatus and process for the selective reduction of nox in nox-containing exhaust gases of internal combustion engines comprising such a catalyst. the introduction of reducing agent into the exhaust gas line in which the catalyst is located makes the reduction of nox possible. the reduction of nox is improved by no2 which is formed by oxidation of no by means of the active component comprising iron oxide which is present in the catalyst.
a process for the selective reduction of nox in nox-containing exhaust gases of internal combustion engines by means of such an apparatus is also provided.

US07666375,method for catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides,"a method comprising subjecting fuel to combustion while the combustion atmosphere of the fuel is oscillated periodically and alternately between rich and lean conditions, leading the exhaust gas formed to a catalytic reactor, and bringing the exhaust gas into contact with a catalyst in the catalytic reactor to conduct catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides contained in the exhaust gas, wherein the catalyst comprises as catalyst components:
(a) an oxide catalyst component a comprising

in particular, the invention relates to a method for catalytic reduction of nox contained in exhaust gas with no deterioration of catalyst even in the presence of sulfur oxides (which mainly comprise so2 and so3, and will be referred to sox hereunder) wherein fuel is supplied and subjected to combustion while the combustion atmosphere of fuel is oscillated between rich conditions and lean conditions periodically, whereby nox is generated in the exhaust gas.
in the invention, by the term ?œlean??is meant an air fuel ratio larger than the stoichiometric air fuel ratio for the fuel in question, while by the term ?œrich??is meant an air fuel ratio smaller than the stoichiometric air fuel ratio for the fuel in question. for normal automobile gasoline, the stoichiometric air fuel ratio is approximately 14.5. further, the term ?œcatalyst??includes a catalyst itself as well as a catalyst structure which contains the catalyst and works to remove nox generated by combustion of fuel.
accordingly, by the term ?œsubjecting fuel to combustion while the combustion atmosphere of the fuel is oscillated between rich conditions and lean conditions periodically and alternately??is especially meant that fuel is supplied, injected or to a combustion chamber of a diesel engine or a gasoline engine, and is subjected to combustion mainly under the lean conditions wherein an air fuel ratio is high (as the oxygen concentration in exhaust gas after combustion of fuel is typically in a range of approximately 5% to 10%) while air fuel ratio is so adjusted that the combustion atmosphere of fuel is periodically and alternately oscillated between the rich conditions and the lean conditions.
the lean conditions wherein an air fuel ratio is high are formed usually by injecting fuel into a combustion chamber of an engine at an air fuel ratio in the range of 20-40. accordingly, ?œhigh air fuel ratio??has a value in the range of 20-40. on the other hand, the rich conditions are formed usually by injecting fuel into a combustion chamber of an engine at an air fuel ratio in the range of 13-14.5 when gasoline is used as fuel, although depending upon oxidation ability of catalyst and the kind and concentration of reducing agent formed under the rich conditions. accordingly, preferred rich conditions are such that the air fuel ratio has a value in the range of 13-14.5
nox contained in exhaust gas has conventionally been removed by, for example, a method in which nox is oxidized and then absorbed in alkaline solution or a method in which nox is reduced to nitrogen by using a reducing agent such as ammonia, hydrogen, carbon monoxide or hydrocarbons. however, these conventional methods have their own disadvantages.
that is, the former method requires a means for handling the resulting alkaline waste liquid to prevent environmental pollution. the latter method, for example, when it uses ammonia as a reducing agent, involves a problem that ammonia reacts with sox in exhaust gas to form salts, resulting in deterioration in catalytic activity at low temperatures. accordingly, when nox from moving sources such as automobiles is to be treated, the safety is a question.
on the other hand, when hydrogen, carbon monoxide or hydrocarbons is used as a reducing agent, the reducing agent reacts preferentially with oxygen since exhaust gas contains oxygen in a higher concentration than nox. this means that substantial reduction of nox needs a large quantity of a reducing agent, and hence resulting in remarkable fall of fuel efficiency.
it has been therefore proposed to catalytically decompose nox in the absence of a reducing agent. however, the catalysts that have been conventionally known for direct decomposition of nox have not yet been put to practical use due to their low decomposition activity for nox. on the other hand, a variety of zeolites have been proposed as a catalyst for catalytic reduction of nox using a hydrocarbon or an oxygen-containing organic compound as a reducing agent. in particular, cu-ion exchanged zsm-5 or h type (hydrogen type or acid type) zeolite zsm-5 (sio2/al2o3 molar ratio=30 to 40) has been regarded as optimal. however, it has been found that even the h type zeolite has no sufficient reduction activity, and particularly the zeolite catalyst is rapidly deactivated on account of dealumination of the zeolite structure when water is contained in exhaust gas.
under these circumstances, it has been necessary to develop a more active catalyst for the catalytic reduction of nox. accordingly, a catalyst composed of an inorganic oxide carrier material having silver or silver oxide supported thereon has recently been proposed, as described in ep-a1-526099 or ep-a1-679427. however, it has been found that the catalyst has a high activity for oxidation, but a low activity for selective reduction of nox, so that the catalyst has a low conversion rate of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen. in addition, the catalyst involves a problem that it is deactivated rapidly in the presence of sulfur oxides. the catalyst catalyzes the selective reduction of nox with hydrocarbons under full lean conditions, but it has a lower nox conversion and a more narrow temperature window (temperature range) than the known three way catalyst. this makes it difficult for such lean nox catalysts to be practically used. thus, there has been a demand for developing a more heat-resistant and more active catalyst for catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides.
in order to overcome the above-mentioned problems, a nox storage-reduction system has recently been proposed as one of the most promising methods, as described in wo 93/7363 or wo 93/8383. in the proposed system, fuel is periodically spiked for a short moment to a combustion chamber in excess of the stoichiometric amount under rich conditions. vehicles with lean burn engines can be driven at lower fuel consumption rates than conventional vehicles. it is because such vehicles can be driven at a much lower fuel/air ratio than the conventional vehicles. this nox storage-reduction system for lean burn engines reduces nox in two periodic steps at intervals of one to two minutes.
that is, in the first step, no is oxidized to no2 on platinum or rhodium catalyst under normal lean conditions, and the no2 is absorbed as a nitrate such as potassium nitrate in an absorbent such an alkali compound as potassium carbonate or barium carbonate. subsequently, rich conditions are formed for the second step, and are maintained for several seconds. under the rich conditions, the absorbed (or stored) no2 is released from the absorbent and is efficiently reduced to nitrogen with hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide or hydrogen on the platinum or rhodium catalyst. this nox storage-reduction system works well over a long period of time in the absence of sox. however, there is a problem that in the presence of sox, the catalytic system deteriorates drastically due to the irreversible absorption of sox at no2 absorption sites on the alkali compound under either the lean or the rich conditions. in addition, since nox is absorbed as a nitrate in the method, it is necessary that the rich conditions are strengthened to decompose and reduce the nitrate under the rich conditions, and consequently the method has a problem that fuel efficiency is deteriorated.
accordingly, for the purpose of remedying the weak point or solving the problem in that the nox storage-reduction system deteriorates in performance in the presence of sox, there has been recently proposed in wo 02/8997 such a catalyst that has a purification ability close to the nox storage-reduction system and a high sox durability. the catalyst comprises:

    (a) an outer catalyst layer comprising an outer catalyst component, wherein the outer catalyst component comprises


(a) ceria or;
(b) praseodymium oxide or;
(c) at least one selected from the group consisting of a mixture of oxides of at least two elements and a composite oxide of at least two elements, the elements being selected from the group consisting of cerium, zirconium, praseodymium, neodymium, gadolinium and lanthanum; and

    (b) an inner catalyst layer comprising an inner catalyst component, wherein the inner catalyst component comprises


(d) at least one selected from the group consisting of platinum, rhodium, palladium and oxides thereof; and
(e) a carrier.
further, there has been proposed in wo 02/22255 a catalyst that has a high sox durability, which comprises an outer catalyst layer comprising a first catalyst component selected from rhodium, palladium and oxides thereof and a second catalyst component selected from zirconia, cerium oxide, praseodymium oxide, neodymium oxide and mixtures thereof, and an inner catalyst layer comprising a third catalyst component selected from rhodium, palladium, platinum and oxides thereof.
it is an object of the invention to provide a method which comprises subjecting fuel to combustion mainly under lean conditions while the combustion atmosphere of fuel is oscillated periodically and alternately between rich and lean conditions, leading the exhaust gas formed to a catalytic reactor, and bringing the exhaust gas into contact with a catalyst in the catalytic reactor to conduct catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides contained in the exhaust gas with high durability and high fuel efficiency even in the presence of oxygen, sulfur oxides and water in a wide range of reaction temperature
in particular, it is an object of the invention to provide a highly efficient method for reduction of nitrogen oxides in a wide temperature range even in the presence of oxygen, sulfur oxides or water, especially even in the presence of sulfur oxides which brings about serious problem to the nox storage catalyst, without generation of harmful ammonia under rich conditions, and with no reaction of absorbed nox with a reducing agent to release nox under rich conditions to gas phase, in which method fuel is subjected to combustion while the atmosphere of combustion of the fuel is oscillated between lean conditions where an air fuel ratio is high and rich conditions.

on the other hand, when hydrogen, carbon monoxide or hydrocarbons is used as a reducing agent, the reducing agent reacts preferentially with oxygen since exhaust gas contains oxygen in a higher concentration than nox. this means that substantial reduction of nox needs a large quantity of a reducing agent, and hence resulting in remarkable fall of fuel efficiency.
it has been therefore proposed to catalytically decompose nox in the absence of a reducing agent. however, the catalysts that have been conventionally known for direct decomposition of nox have not yet been put to practical use due to their low decomposition activity for nox. on the other hand, a variety of zeolites have been proposed as a catalyst for catalytic reduction of nox using a hydrocarbon or an oxygen-containing organic compound as a reducing agent. in particular, cu-ion exchanged zsm-5 or h type (hydrogen type or acid type) zeolite zsm-5 (sio2/al2o3 molar ratio=30 to 40) has been regarded as optimal. however, it has been found that even the h type zeolite has no sufficient reduction activity, and particularly the zeolite catalyst is rapidly deactivated on account of dealumination of the zeolite structure when water is contained in exhaust gas.
under these circumstances, it has been necessary to develop a more active catalyst for the catalytic reduction of nox. accordingly, a catalyst composed of an inorganic oxide carrier material having silver or silver oxide supported thereon has recently been proposed, as described in ep-a1-526099 or ep-a1-679427. however, it has been found that the catalyst has a high activity for oxidation, but a low activity for selective reduction of nox, so that the catalyst has a low conversion rate of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen. in addition, the catalyst involves a problem that it is deactivated rapidly in the presence of sulfur oxides. the catalyst catalyzes the selective reduction of nox with hydrocarbons under full lean conditions, but it has a lower nox conversion and a more narrow temperature window (temperature range) than the known three way catalyst. this makes it difficult for such lean nox catalysts to be practically used. thus, there has been a demand for developing a more heat-resistant and more active catalyst for catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides.
in order to overcome the above-mentioned problems, a nox storage-reduction system has recently been proposed as one of the most promising methods, as described in wo 93/7363 or wo 93/8383. in the proposed system, fuel is periodically spiked for a short moment to a combustion chamber in excess of the stoichiometric amount under rich conditions. vehicles with lean burn engines can be driven at lower fuel consumption rates than conventional vehicles. it is because such vehicles can be driven at a much lower fuel/air ratio than the conventional vehicles. this nox storage-reduction system for lean burn engines reduces nox in two periodic steps at intervals of one to two minutes.
that is, in the first step, no is oxidized to no2 on platinum or rhodium catalyst under normal lean conditions, and the no2 is absorbed as a nitrate such as potassium nitrate in an absorbent such an alkali compound as potassium carbonate or barium carbonate. subsequently, rich conditions are formed for the second step, and are maintained for several seconds. under the rich conditions, the absorbed (or stored) no2 is released from the absorbent and is efficiently reduced to nitrogen with hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide or hydrogen on the platinum or rhodium catalyst. this nox storage-reduction system works well over a long period of time in the absence of sox. however, there is a problem that in the presence of sox, the catalytic system deteriorates drastically due to the irreversible absorption of sox at no2 absorption sites on the alkali compound under either the lean or the rich conditions. in addition, since nox is absorbed as a nitrate in the method, it is necessary that the rich conditions are strengthened to decompose and reduce the nitrate under the rich conditions, and consequently the method has a problem that fuel efficiency is deteriorated.
accordingly, for the purpose of remedying the weak point or solving the problem in that the nox storage-reduction system deteriorates in performance in the presence of sox, there has been recently proposed in wo 02/8997 such a catalyst that has a purification ability close to the nox storage-reduction system and a high sox durability. the catalyst comprises:

    (b) an inner catalyst layer comprising an inner catalyst component, wherein the inner catalyst component comprises


(d) at least one selected from the group consisting of platinum, rhodium, palladium and oxides thereof; and

that is, the former method requires a means for handling the resulting alkaline waste liquid to prevent environmental pollution. the latter method, for example, when it uses ammonia as a reducing agent, involves a problem that ammonia reacts with sox in exhaust gas to form salts, resulting in deterioration in catalytic activity at low temperatures. accordingly, when nox from moving sources such as automobiles is to be treated, the safety is a question.
on the other hand, when hydrogen, carbon monoxide or hydrocarbons is used as a reducing agent, the reducing agent reacts preferentially with oxygen since exhaust gas contains oxygen in a higher concentration than nox. this means that substantial reduction of nox needs a large quantity of a reducing agent, and hence resulting in remarkable fall of fuel efficiency.
it has been therefore proposed to catalytically decompose nox in the absence of a reducing agent. however, the catalysts that have been conventionally known for direct decomposition of nox have not yet been put to practical use due to their low decomposition activity for nox. on the other hand, a variety of zeolites have been proposed as a catalyst for catalytic reduction of nox using a hydrocarbon or an oxygen-containing organic compound as a reducing agent. in particular, cu-ion exchanged zsm-5 or h type (hydrogen type or acid type) zeolite zsm-5 (sio2/al2o3 molar ratio=30 to 40) has been regarded as optimal. however, it has been found that even the h type zeolite has no sufficient reduction activity, and particularly the zeolite catalyst is rapidly deactivated on account of dealumination of the zeolite structure when water is contained in exhaust gas.
under these circumstances, it has been necessary to develop a more active catalyst for the catalytic reduction of nox. accordingly, a catalyst composed of an inorganic oxide carrier material having silver or silver oxide supported thereon has recently been proposed, as described in ep-a1-526099 or ep-a1-679427. however, it has been found that the catalyst has a high activity for oxidation, but a low activity for selective reduction of nox, so that the catalyst has a low conversion rate of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen. in addition, the catalyst involves a problem that it is deactivated rapidly in the presence of sulfur oxides. the catalyst catalyzes the selective reduction of nox with hydrocarbons under full lean conditions, but it has a lower nox conversion and a more narrow temperature window (temperature range) than the known three way catalyst. this makes it difficult for such lean nox catalysts to be practically used. thus, there has been a demand for developing a more heat-resistant and more active catalyst for catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides.
in order to overcome the above-mentioned problems, a nox storage-reduction system has recently been proposed as one of the most promising methods, as described in wo 93/7363 or wo 93/8383. in the proposed system, fuel is periodically spiked for a short moment to a combustion chamber in excess of the stoichiometric amount under rich conditions. vehicles with lean burn engines can be driven at lower fuel consumption rates than conventional vehicles. it is because such vehicles can be driven at a much lower fuel/air ratio than the conventional vehicles. this nox storage-reduction system for lean burn engines reduces nox in two periodic steps at intervals of one to two minutes.
that is, in the first step, no is oxidized to no2 on platinum or rhodium catalyst under normal lean conditions, and the no2 is absorbed as a nitrate such as potassium nitrate in an absorbent such an alkali compound as potassium carbonate or barium carbonate. subsequently, rich conditions are formed for the second step, and are maintained for several seconds. under the rich conditions, the absorbed (or stored) no2 is released from the absorbent and is efficiently reduced to nitrogen with hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide or hydrogen on the platinum or rhodium catalyst. this nox storage-reduction system works well over a long period of time in the absence of sox. however, there is a problem that in the presence of sox, the catalytic system deteriorates drastically due to the irreversible absorption of sox at no2 absorption sites on the alkali compound under either the lean or the rich conditions. in addition, since nox is absorbed as a nitrate in the method, it is necessary that the rich conditions are strengthened to decompose and reduce the nitrate under the rich conditions, and consequently the method has a problem that fuel efficiency is deteriorated.
accordingly, for the purpose of remedying the weak point or solving the problem in that the nox storage-reduction system deteriorates in performance in the presence of sox, there has been recently proposed in wo 02/8997 such a catalyst that has a purification ability close to the nox storage-reduction system and a high sox durability. the catalyst comprises:

    (b) an inner catalyst layer comprising an inner catalyst component, wherein the inner catalyst component comprises


(d) at least one selected from the group consisting of platinum, rhodium, palladium and oxides thereof; and

the lean conditions wherein an air fuel ratio is high are formed usually by injecting fuel into a combustion chamber of an engine at an air fuel ratio in the range of 20-40. accordingly, ?œhigh air fuel ratio??has a value in the range of 20-40. on the other hand, the rich conditions are formed usually by injecting fuel into a combustion chamber of an engine at an air fuel ratio in the range of 13-14.5 when gasoline is used as fuel, although depending upon oxidation ability of catalyst and the kind and concentration of reducing agent formed under the rich conditions. accordingly, preferred rich conditions are such that the air fuel ratio has a value in the range of 13-14.5
nox contained in exhaust gas has conventionally been removed by, for example, a method in which nox is oxidized and then absorbed in alkaline solution or a method in which nox is reduced to nitrogen by using a reducing agent such as ammonia, hydrogen, carbon monoxide or hydrocarbons. however, these conventional methods have their own disadvantages.
that is, the former method requires a means for handling the resulting alkaline waste liquid to prevent environmental pollution. the latter method, for example, when it uses ammonia as a reducing agent, involves a problem that ammonia reacts with sox in exhaust gas to form salts, resulting in deterioration in catalytic activity at low temperatures. accordingly, when nox from moving sources such as automobiles is to be treated, the safety is a question.
on the other hand, when hydrogen, carbon monoxide or hydrocarbons is used as a reducing agent, the reducing agent reacts preferentially with oxygen since exhaust gas contains oxygen in a higher concentration than nox. this means that substantial reduction of nox needs a large quantity of a reducing agent, and hence resulting in remarkable fall of fuel efficiency.
it has been therefore proposed to catalytically decompose nox in the absence of a reducing agent. however, the catalysts that have been conventionally known for direct decomposition of nox have not yet been put to practical use due to their low decomposition activity for nox. on the other hand, a variety of zeolites have been proposed as a catalyst for catalytic reduction of nox using a hydrocarbon or an oxygen-containing organic compound as a reducing agent. in particular, cu-ion exchanged zsm-5 or h type (hydrogen type or acid type) zeolite zsm-5 (sio2/al2o3 molar ratio=30 to 40) has been regarded as optimal. however, it has been found that even the h type zeolite has no sufficient reduction activity, and particularly the zeolite catalyst is rapidly deactivated on account of dealumination of the zeolite structure when water is contained in exhaust gas.
under these circumstances, it has been necessary to develop a more active catalyst for the catalytic reduction of nox. accordingly, a catalyst composed of an inorganic oxide carrier material having silver or silver oxide supported thereon has recently been proposed, as described in ep-a1-526099 or ep-a1-679427. however, it has been found that the catalyst has a high activity for oxidation, but a low activity for selective reduction of nox, so that the catalyst has a low conversion rate of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen. in addition, the catalyst involves a problem that it is deactivated rapidly in the presence of sulfur oxides. the catalyst catalyzes the selective reduction of nox with hydrocarbons under full lean conditions, but it has a lower nox conversion and a more narrow temperature window (temperature range) than the known three way catalyst. this makes it difficult for such lean nox catalysts to be practically used. thus, there has been a demand for developing a more heat-resistant and more active catalyst for catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides.
in order to overcome the above-mentioned problems, a nox storage-reduction system has recently been proposed as one of the most promising methods, as described in wo 93/7363 or wo 93/8383. in the proposed system, fuel is periodically spiked for a short moment to a combustion chamber in excess of the stoichiometric amount under rich conditions. vehicles with lean burn engines can be driven at lower fuel consumption rates than conventional vehicles. it is because such vehicles can be driven at a much lower fuel/air ratio than the conventional vehicles. this nox storage-reduction system for lean burn engines reduces nox in two periodic steps at intervals of one to two minutes.
that is, in the first step, no is oxidized to no2 on platinum or rhodium catalyst under normal lean conditions, and the no2 is absorbed as a nitrate such as potassium nitrate in an absorbent such an alkali compound as potassium carbonate or barium carbonate. subsequently, rich conditions are formed for the second step, and are maintained for several seconds. under the rich conditions, the absorbed (or stored) no2 is released from the absorbent and is efficiently reduced to nitrogen with hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide or hydrogen on the platinum or rhodium catalyst. this nox storage-reduction system works well over a long period of time in the absence of sox. however, there is a problem that in the presence of sox, the catalytic system deteriorates drastically due to the irreversible absorption of sox at no2 absorption sites on the alkali compound under either the lean or the rich conditions. in addition, since nox is absorbed as a nitrate in the method, it is necessary that the rich conditions are strengthened to decompose and reduce the nitrate under the rich conditions, and consequently the method has a problem that fuel efficiency is deteriorated.
accordingly, for the purpose of remedying the weak point or solving the problem in that the nox storage-reduction system deteriorates in performance in the presence of sox, there has been recently proposed in wo 02/8997 such a catalyst that has a purification ability close to the nox storage-reduction system and a high sox durability. the catalyst comprises:

(d) at least one selected from the group consisting of platinum, rhodium, palladium and oxides thereof; and
(e) a carrier.
further, there has been proposed in wo 02/22255 a catalyst that has a high sox durability, which comprises an outer catalyst layer comprising a first catalyst component selected from rhodium, palladium and oxides thereof and a second catalyst component selected from zirconia, cerium oxide, praseodymium oxide, neodymium oxide and mixtures thereof, and an inner catalyst layer comprising a third catalyst component selected from rhodium, palladium, platinum and oxides thereof.
it is an object of the invention to provide a method which comprises subjecting fuel to combustion mainly under lean conditions while the combustion atmosphere of fuel is oscillated periodically and alternately between rich and lean conditions, leading the exhaust gas formed to a catalytic reactor, and bringing the exhaust gas into contact with a catalyst in the catalytic reactor to conduct catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides contained in the exhaust gas with high durability and high fuel efficiency even in the presence of oxygen, sulfur oxides and water in a wide range of reaction temperature
in particular, it is an object of the invention to provide a highly efficient method for reduction of nitrogen oxides in a wide temperature range even in the presence of oxygen, sulfur oxides or water, especially even in the presence of sulfur oxides which brings about serious problem to the nox storage catalyst, without generation of harmful ammonia under rich conditions, and with no reaction of absorbed nox with a reducing agent to release nox under rich conditions to gas phase, in which method fuel is subjected to combustion while the atmosphere of combustion of the fuel is oscillated between lean conditions where an air fuel ratio is high and rich conditions.

US07666376,diesel particulate filter comprising a finely dispersed diesel particulate catalyst,"the invention relates to a device for the, (in particular continuous), oxidation of particulates from the exhaust gases of diesel motors. said device consists of an open-pored body as a particle filter, on whose surface an oxidation catalyst is finely dispersed. the device is characterized in that from an exhaust gas temperature as low as 150Â° c., the catalyst causes the oxidation of particulates attached to the filter using the residual oxygen of the exhaust gas, thus keeping the filter body continuously free of particulates during almost all the operating conditions of the motor.","the invention relates to a particulate filter comprising a particulate catalyst, a method for producing the particulate filter as well its use.
known diesel particulate filters comprise catalysts by means of which a blocking of the filter is counteracted. such catalysts are called diesel particulate catalysts. particulate catalysts from the exhaust gases of diesel engines settle on or in a filter, which consists of an open-pored body as a particle filter. a catalyst is applied hereon. by means of the catalyst, the particulates are, for example, oxidized.
in the last several decades, the continuous development of diesel engines for vehicles having a maximum allowable total weight of under 2.5 tons led to an ever greater reduction in the emission of pollutants. thanks to the introduction of improved fuel injection technologies and/or an exhaust gas recirculation, modern diesel engines for small trucks and passenger cars only emit about 0.5 g/km of particulates, as well as around 100 ppm of nitrogen oxides in the partial load range. the current rate of development suggests, however, that the optimum with regard to the level of both pollutants in the exhaust gas has been reached, since any further attempt to lower the amount of one of the two components through design modifications of the diesel engine automatically leads to an increase in the production of the other pollutant. for the year 2005, however, the eu plans to drastically further lower the limiting value for this kind of diesel vehicles to 0.25 g/km for nitrogen oxides and 0.025 g/km for particles. in order to comply with these emission limits, a suitable secondary treatment of the exhaust gases is required. at present, efforts concentrate on the reduction of particulates from the exhaust gases since the emission of the nitrogen oxides already comes very close to the planned upper limiting value.
particulate filters which, depending on their constructive design, filter out up to 95 wt-% of the carbon-particulate matter are an effective method for the reduction of particulates from the diesel exhaust gases. so-called wall-flow filters with a honeycomb-like structure in which their flow channels are alternatively blocked so that the exhaust gas must flow through the porous filter walls, are widely used.
however, the filters become blocked when the load of particulates increases, which leads to an increase in flow resistance and, correspondingly, to a reduction in engine performance. in order to counteract this blocking, the filters must, continually or in cyclical intervals, be freed of the carbon-particulate matter. the regeneration methods used at present in particle filters are based on thermal combustion, catalytic processes or on a combination of both methods.
for a purely thermal regeneration, temperatures in excess of 600Â° c. are required, temperatures which, however, the exhaust gas only reaches under few operating conditions of the engine. therefore, either fuel-driven burners or electrically powered heating elements are used in this kind of cleaning, as can be seen in printed publications de 19810738 c1 or de 4110395 a1.
because of the high energy demand of a purely thermal regeneration, additives which can lower the ignition temperature of the settled particulates down to 400Â° c. are also used in the fuel in certain methods. for example, psa peugeot citroÃ«n describes a process in which an organic cerium compound is continually mixed with the fuel. this procedure effects a corresponding metal oxide enrichment of the carbon-particulate matter which is removed from the exhaust gases on a particle filter. regeneration takes place in cyclical intervals by a short-term increase of the exhaust gas temperature to over 450Â° c., which leads to a burn-off of the filter-bound carbon-particulate matter which has been thus ?œactivated?? in order to reach this ignition temperature in the regeneration cycle, a relatively large amount of fuel is injected into the combustion chamber which effects an increase in hydrocarbon emission in the exhaust gases. this increase in concentration is calculated so that its oxidation in a platinum catalyst preceding the particle filter leads to a heating of the exhaust gas up to the regeneration temperature.
further thermal regeneration methods are based on generating nitrogen dioxide as an oxidant for the filter-bound soot. for example, ep 341832 b1 and ep 1055805 a1 describe devices which consist of an oxidation catalyst for converting nitrogen oxide no into nitrogen dioxide no2 by means of residual oxygen in the exhaust gases, and a subsequent particle filter. in this case, the burn-off of the carbon-particulate matter occurs in a continuous manner even at temperatures below 400Â° c. if a sufficient concentration of nitrogen oxide is present in the exhaust gases. if necessary, the combustion of the carbon-particulate matter is supported by a suitable catalytic coating of the filter surface, as can bee seen from printed publications ep 0341832 a1 or wo 01/12320 a1, or from ep 0758713. the purely catalytic methods described are so-called self-cleaning of self-regenerating particle filters, which only oxidizes the surface-bound carbon-particulate matter because of a catalytic coating of the filter. printed publication u.s. pat. no. 6,013,599 describes an oxidation catalyst for particulates on the basis of mixed oxides which consists of the metal oxides of copper, iron and vanadium which, from an exhaust gas temperature of 380Â° c. upwards, leads to a cleaning of the filter-bound carbon-particulate matter. printed publication u.s. pat. no. 5,100,632 also discloses a self-cleaning diesel particulate filter, in which the ignition temperature of the carbon-particulate matter is lowered to 355Â° c. by a combination of a platinum/rhodium coating of the filter surface with an alkaline earth metal oxide.
therefore, in all known regeneration methods, exhaust gas temperatures in excess of 355Â° c. are required in order to keep the particulate filter clear. since these cannot be reached in many operating conditions of modern diesel engines, these methods are only suitable to a limited extent for the practical use in vehicles with a maximum allowable total weight of under 2.5 tons. furthermore, all methods with an external application of energy into the exhaust gas system generally lower the degree of efficiency of the engine.
therefore, it is the object of the invention to provide a filter which can be regenerated at comparatively lower exhaust gas temperatures. a further subject matter of the invention is the creation of a method for the production of the device.
the object of the invention is achieved by a device comprising the characterizing features of the first claim and the dependent claim. advantageous embodiments arise from the dependent features. a production method as well as an advantageous manner of use arise from the corresponding dependent claims.
according to the invention, the object is achieved by a particulate filter comprising an open-pored body as a particle filter and a finely dispersed catalyst. a finely dispersed catalyst according to the invention is present when particulates cannot settle between two catalytically active centers. the fine dispersion on the surface of the body therefore results in an intensive contact between particulates which have settled thereon and the catalyst. in this way, a continuous oxidation of the carbon-particulate matter by the oxidants of the exhaust gases can be achieved from as low an exhaust gas temperature as 150Â° c. furthermore, in principle, it is possible in this way that the catalyst may also take effect by using the residual oxygen of the exhaust gases.
the invention is based on the observation that the reaction capacity of an oxidation catalyst for diesel particulates settled in open-pored bodies increased corresponding to an increase of density by area of the catalytically active centers on the boundary surface accessible to the particulates which adjoins the gas space. this observation was supported by the knowledge that particulates which have settled on surfaces remain on the location of settling (in contrast to gas molecules) and cannot be sufficiently mobilized even by taking process engineering measures. therefore, in catalytic particulate oxidation, the effective cross-section of the catalytically active centers in relation to area is much smaller than in heterogeneous gas catalysis, since the basic way in which a catalyst functions is based on direct contact with the participants in a reaction. in order to ensure sufficient particulate reaction activity, a fine dispersion of the catalyst is provided on the boundary surface accessible to the particulates which adjoins the gas space. a preferred dispersion has therefore been attained when the average distance of the individual catalytically active centers in relation to each other does just about not exceed the diameter of the smallest settled particulate unit (the so-called primary particulate structure). in that case, particulates cannot settle between catalyst material without coming into contact with the catalyst. if a particulate were able to settle on the body without having contact with the catalyst material, it would hardly be removable by catalysis.
since at present the size of the so-called primary particulate structures in the exhaust gases is between 20 and 30 nm, a correspondingly finely dispersed catalyst coating would be the aim. the distance between two catalytically active centers would, in that case, generally not exceed 20 nm in order to be able to remove completely, by catalysis, the particulates settling on the body.
as well as the noble metals pt, pd, rh, re, or ru, or transition-metal oxides, such as e.g. v2o5, ceo2, la2o3, mno2, cuo, and mixtures or mixed oxides from and containing these compounds, all known types of catalyst which oxidize particulates are considered suitable.
however, catalysts are preferred which at least partially consist of noble metal oxides, in particular rhodium oxide rh2o3, or which consist of oxides of yttrium and manganese or of mixed oxides from and containing these compounds, in particular yttrium manganite ymn2o5. finely dispersed, these compounds showed the highest capacity for oxidizing carbon-particulate matter, and, in contrast to known noble metals and transition-metal oxides, did so even utilizing the residual oxygen content of the exhaust gases. this capacity for oxidizing carbon-particulate matter already began at a temperature of under 150Â° c. surprisingly, these catalysts showed very little activity when tested for their capacity for oxidizing hydrocarbons.
in the presence of about 300 ppm nitrogen oxide in the particulate-loaded reaction gas, the specific particulate oxidation activity of these catalysts nearly doubled, so that a finely dispersed diesel particulate catalyst is preferably to be mounted, within the exhaust system, behind a nitrogen monoxide oxidation catalyst for generating nitrogen dioxide.
basically, all open-pored bodies and fills made of ceramic and metallic material, or combinations of both, which have a high removal capacity for particulates over the total size range from dp=3 nm to dp=10 Î¼m and allow a fine dispersion of the catalyst on the surface, are considered suitable for the device according to the invention.
advantageously, a so-called depth filter is used, which in comparison to surface filters has a greater filter surface accessible to particulates. the filter body can be kept free continually when a depth filter is used. advantageously, a so-called depth filter is used, which in comparison to surface filters has a greater surface which can be occupied by large particulates (with a diameter of dp>100 nm). this advantage is based on the different designs of the pore structure in the two filter types. in depth filters, the open pore system is designed so that even the larger particulates can be removed deep within the filter body, whereby the effect of the filter extends over the total volume or the total surface of the filter. in surface filters, the pore structure which is a consequence of the design prevents penetration of these large particulates into the filter body, so that, to the greater extent, only the smaller outer part of the filter surface is occupied by the particulates. the intended fast formation of a filter cake associated with this process would make it difficult to keep a surface filter continually free by means of a finely dispersed particulate catalyst coating.
preferably, the filter is combined with an electric heater. in particular, the electrical heater known from printed publication de 19718239 a1 is used to eliminate reliably the blocking of the finely dispersed diesel catalyst in cases of emergency or under unfavorable operating conditions of the diesel engine, for example, a cold start.
in some cases, depending on the particulate load of the diesel exhaust gases or the desired filter efficiency, the combination of a depth filter with a subsequent surface filter which are both coated with catalyst material in a finely dispersed manner may be a preferable embodiment of the device according to the invention. by this measure, depending on the open porosity the individual modules are set to, a well directed fractionated removal of the particles is possible, which, if dimensioned favorably, results in an increase of the total degree of efficiency of the filter while at the same time minimizing the loss of pressure over the total extent of the filter.
it is the aim of the invention to provide a filter surface whose properties make a high rate of occupation by unit of area of the catalytically active centers possible, preferably permanently or for as long as possible.
the requirements with regard to the pore structure or the real surface of the suitable carrier materials are low compared with those of heterogeneous gas catalysts. nanoporous carrier structures with pore diameters of less than 20 nm are not suitable, since, because of the size distribution of the particulates (dp>20 nm) in the exhaust gases, these particles cannot enter the pore system. therefore, if a catalyst were located there it would not add to the catalytic oxidation of particulates.
the carrier surface of the filter body according to the invention is only oriented on the boundary layer between the gas space and the carrier material which is accessible for the particulates. this so-called separation surface essentially does not differ from the actually available geometric boundary surface of the particle filters adjoining the gas space.
with regard to selection and spatial configuration of the carrier material, those measures are advantageous which contribute to maximizing the specific boundary surface carrying the catalyst. such measures include optimization of surface roughness or the generation of open Î¼m-pores close to the surface.
thus, the known wash-coat processes are only suitable to a limited extent for producing the finely dispersed diesel particulate catalyst of the invention, since precursor compounds of the catalysts such as, e.g., water-soluble salts of noble metals, together with suitable ceramic powders, are applied to the carrier surfaces in the form of a suspension. after the coating has solidified and has been fixed by a calcination step, the catalyst is now activated and dispersed over the whole resulting thickness of the layer, therefore being, at least partially, inaccessible to the particulates. therefore, in order to achieve a fine dispersion of the catalytically active centers on the separation surface according to the invention, the concentration, in the coating suspension, of the compounds forming the catalyst must be strongly increased. such a measure is only feasible to a limited extent for reasons based on coating technology, as well as when noble metals are used.
therefore, a method is preferred in which the catalyst particles are directly applied to the surface of a particle filter, in particular, these are pre-shaped and/or of nano scale, i.e. with diameters smaller than 100 nm. therefore, the application, for example, is effected by using?”in particular nano disperse?”catalyst-colloid-coating solutions, which, for example, have been produced by using sol-gel technology or by a synthesis by means of micro- and miniemulsions.
in order to improve the fine dispersion of the catalyst particles onto the filter surface or the dosing of the amount of catalyst, it is advantageous to put opposite electric charges on the particles as well as on the filter boundary surfaces. as an auxiliary means for charging, all surface-active ionic compounds (such as, for example, polydiallyldimethylammoniumchloride or polyacrylic acid are considered suitable, which can be applied to the respective surface with enough adhesion, and which can be removed from the border surface by means of a calcination, leaving little residue.
in order to improve the effectiveness of the regeneration, additional oxygen is introduced into the filter during operation. ozone, which is particularly reactive, is to be preferred.",1,problem,emission of pollutants,1.0,exact,1
US07666376,diesel particulate filter comprising a finely dispersed diesel particulate catalyst,"the invention relates to a device for the, (in particular continuous), oxidation of particulates from the exhaust gases of diesel motors. said device consists of an open-pored body as a particle filter, on whose surface an oxidation catalyst is finely dispersed. the device is characterized in that from an exhaust gas temperature as low as 150Â° c., the catalyst causes the oxidation of particulates attached to the filter using the residual oxygen of the exhaust gas, thus keeping the filter body continuously free of particulates during almost all the operating conditions of the motor.","the invention relates to a particulate filter comprising a particulate catalyst, a method for producing the particulate filter as well its use.
known diesel particulate filters comprise catalysts by means of which a blocking of the filter is counteracted. such catalysts are called diesel particulate catalysts. particulate catalysts from the exhaust gases of diesel engines settle on or in a filter, which consists of an open-pored body as a particle filter. a catalyst is applied hereon. by means of the catalyst, the particulates are, for example, oxidized.
in the last several decades, the continuous development of diesel engines for vehicles having a maximum allowable total weight of under 2.5 tons led to an ever greater reduction in the emission of pollutants. thanks to the introduction of improved fuel injection technologies and/or an exhaust gas recirculation, modern diesel engines for small trucks and passenger cars only emit about 0.5 g/km of particulates, as well as around 100 ppm of nitrogen oxides in the partial load range. the current rate of development suggests, however, that the optimum with regard to the level of both pollutants in the exhaust gas has been reached, since any further attempt to lower the amount of one of the two components through design modifications of the diesel engine automatically leads to an increase in the production of the other pollutant. for the year 2005, however, the eu plans to drastically further lower the limiting value for this kind of diesel vehicles to 0.25 g/km for nitrogen oxides and 0.025 g/km for particles. in order to comply with these emission limits, a suitable secondary treatment of the exhaust gases is required. at present, efforts concentrate on the reduction of particulates from the exhaust gases since the emission of the nitrogen oxides already comes very close to the planned upper limiting value.
particulate filters which, depending on their constructive design, filter out up to 95 wt-% of the carbon-particulate matter are an effective method for the reduction of particulates from the diesel exhaust gases. so-called wall-flow filters with a honeycomb-like structure in which their flow channels are alternatively blocked so that the exhaust gas must flow through the porous filter walls, are widely used.
however, the filters become blocked when the load of particulates increases, which leads to an increase in flow resistance and, correspondingly, to a reduction in engine performance. in order to counteract this blocking, the filters must, continually or in cyclical intervals, be freed of the carbon-particulate matter. the regeneration methods used at present in particle filters are based on thermal combustion, catalytic processes or on a combination of both methods.
for a purely thermal regeneration, temperatures in excess of 600Â° c. are required, temperatures which, however, the exhaust gas only reaches under few operating conditions of the engine. therefore, either fuel-driven burners or electrically powered heating elements are used in this kind of cleaning, as can be seen in printed publications de 19810738 c1 or de 4110395 a1.
because of the high energy demand of a purely thermal regeneration, additives which can lower the ignition temperature of the settled particulates down to 400Â° c. are also used in the fuel in certain methods. for example, psa peugeot citroÃ«n describes a process in which an organic cerium compound is continually mixed with the fuel. this procedure effects a corresponding metal oxide enrichment of the carbon-particulate matter which is removed from the exhaust gases on a particle filter. regeneration takes place in cyclical intervals by a short-term increase of the exhaust gas temperature to over 450Â° c., which leads to a burn-off of the filter-bound carbon-particulate matter which has been thus ?œactivated?? in order to reach this ignition temperature in the regeneration cycle, a relatively large amount of fuel is injected into the combustion chamber which effects an increase in hydrocarbon emission in the exhaust gases. this increase in concentration is calculated so that its oxidation in a platinum catalyst preceding the particle filter leads to a heating of the exhaust gas up to the regeneration temperature.
further thermal regeneration methods are based on generating nitrogen dioxide as an oxidant for the filter-bound soot. for example, ep 341832 b1 and ep 1055805 a1 describe devices which consist of an oxidation catalyst for converting nitrogen oxide no into nitrogen dioxide no2 by means of residual oxygen in the exhaust gases, and a subsequent particle filter. in this case, the burn-off of the carbon-particulate matter occurs in a continuous manner even at temperatures below 400Â° c. if a sufficient concentration of nitrogen oxide is present in the exhaust gases. if necessary, the combustion of the carbon-particulate matter is supported by a suitable catalytic coating of the filter surface, as can bee seen from printed publications ep 0341832 a1 or wo 01/12320 a1, or from ep 0758713. the purely catalytic methods described are so-called self-cleaning of self-regenerating particle filters, which only oxidizes the surface-bound carbon-particulate matter because of a catalytic coating of the filter. printed publication u.s. pat. no. 6,013,599 describes an oxidation catalyst for particulates on the basis of mixed oxides which consists of the metal oxides of copper, iron and vanadium which, from an exhaust gas temperature of 380Â° c. upwards, leads to a cleaning of the filter-bound carbon-particulate matter. printed publication u.s. pat. no. 5,100,632 also discloses a self-cleaning diesel particulate filter, in which the ignition temperature of the carbon-particulate matter is lowered to 355Â° c. by a combination of a platinum/rhodium coating of the filter surface with an alkaline earth metal oxide.
therefore, in all known regeneration methods, exhaust gas temperatures in excess of 355Â° c. are required in order to keep the particulate filter clear. since these cannot be reached in many operating conditions of modern diesel engines, these methods are only suitable to a limited extent for the practical use in vehicles with a maximum allowable total weight of under 2.5 tons. furthermore, all methods with an external application of energy into the exhaust gas system generally lower the degree of efficiency of the engine.
therefore, it is the object of the invention to provide a filter which can be regenerated at comparatively lower exhaust gas temperatures. a further subject matter of the invention is the creation of a method for the production of the device.
the object of the invention is achieved by a device comprising the characterizing features of the first claim and the dependent claim. advantageous embodiments arise from the dependent features. a production method as well as an advantageous manner of use arise from the corresponding dependent claims.
according to the invention, the object is achieved by a particulate filter comprising an open-pored body as a particle filter and a finely dispersed catalyst. a finely dispersed catalyst according to the invention is present when particulates cannot settle between two catalytically active centers. the fine dispersion on the surface of the body therefore results in an intensive contact between particulates which have settled thereon and the catalyst. in this way, a continuous oxidation of the carbon-particulate matter by the oxidants of the exhaust gases can be achieved from as low an exhaust gas temperature as 150Â° c. furthermore, in principle, it is possible in this way that the catalyst may also take effect by using the residual oxygen of the exhaust gases.
the invention is based on the observation that the reaction capacity of an oxidation catalyst for diesel particulates settled in open-pored bodies increased corresponding to an increase of density by area of the catalytically active centers on the boundary surface accessible to the particulates which adjoins the gas space. this observation was supported by the knowledge that particulates which have settled on surfaces remain on the location of settling (in contrast to gas molecules) and cannot be sufficiently mobilized even by taking process engineering measures. therefore, in catalytic particulate oxidation, the effective cross-section of the catalytically active centers in relation to area is much smaller than in heterogeneous gas catalysis, since the basic way in which a catalyst functions is based on direct contact with the participants in a reaction. in order to ensure sufficient particulate reaction activity, a fine dispersion of the catalyst is provided on the boundary surface accessible to the particulates which adjoins the gas space. a preferred dispersion has therefore been attained when the average distance of the individual catalytically active centers in relation to each other does just about not exceed the diameter of the smallest settled particulate unit (the so-called primary particulate structure). in that case, particulates cannot settle between catalyst material without coming into contact with the catalyst. if a particulate were able to settle on the body without having contact with the catalyst material, it would hardly be removable by catalysis.
since at present the size of the so-called primary particulate structures in the exhaust gases is between 20 and 30 nm, a correspondingly finely dispersed catalyst coating would be the aim. the distance between two catalytically active centers would, in that case, generally not exceed 20 nm in order to be able to remove completely, by catalysis, the particulates settling on the body.
as well as the noble metals pt, pd, rh, re, or ru, or transition-metal oxides, such as e.g. v2o5, ceo2, la2o3, mno2, cuo, and mixtures or mixed oxides from and containing these compounds, all known types of catalyst which oxidize particulates are considered suitable.
however, catalysts are preferred which at least partially consist of noble metal oxides, in particular rhodium oxide rh2o3, or which consist of oxides of yttrium and manganese or of mixed oxides from and containing these compounds, in particular yttrium manganite ymn2o5. finely dispersed, these compounds showed the highest capacity for oxidizing carbon-particulate matter, and, in contrast to known noble metals and transition-metal oxides, did so even utilizing the residual oxygen content of the exhaust gases. this capacity for oxidizing carbon-particulate matter already began at a temperature of under 150Â° c. surprisingly, these catalysts showed very little activity when tested for their capacity for oxidizing hydrocarbons.
in the presence of about 300 ppm nitrogen oxide in the particulate-loaded reaction gas, the specific particulate oxidation activity of these catalysts nearly doubled, so that a finely dispersed diesel particulate catalyst is preferably to be mounted, within the exhaust system, behind a nitrogen monoxide oxidation catalyst for generating nitrogen dioxide.
basically, all open-pored bodies and fills made of ceramic and metallic material, or combinations of both, which have a high removal capacity for particulates over the total size range from dp=3 nm to dp=10 Î¼m and allow a fine dispersion of the catalyst on the surface, are considered suitable for the device according to the invention.
advantageously, a so-called depth filter is used, which in comparison to surface filters has a greater filter surface accessible to particulates. the filter body can be kept free continually when a depth filter is used. advantageously, a so-called depth filter is used, which in comparison to surface filters has a greater surface which can be occupied by large particulates (with a diameter of dp>100 nm). this advantage is based on the different designs of the pore structure in the two filter types. in depth filters, the open pore system is designed so that even the larger particulates can be removed deep within the filter body, whereby the effect of the filter extends over the total volume or the total surface of the filter. in surface filters, the pore structure which is a consequence of the design prevents penetration of these large particulates into the filter body, so that, to the greater extent, only the smaller outer part of the filter surface is occupied by the particulates. the intended fast formation of a filter cake associated with this process would make it difficult to keep a surface filter continually free by means of a finely dispersed particulate catalyst coating.
preferably, the filter is combined with an electric heater. in particular, the electrical heater known from printed publication de 19718239 a1 is used to eliminate reliably the blocking of the finely dispersed diesel catalyst in cases of emergency or under unfavorable operating conditions of the diesel engine, for example, a cold start.
in some cases, depending on the particulate load of the diesel exhaust gases or the desired filter efficiency, the combination of a depth filter with a subsequent surface filter which are both coated with catalyst material in a finely dispersed manner may be a preferable embodiment of the device according to the invention. by this measure, depending on the open porosity the individual modules are set to, a well directed fractionated removal of the particles is possible, which, if dimensioned favorably, results in an increase of the total degree of efficiency of the filter while at the same time minimizing the loss of pressure over the total extent of the filter.
it is the aim of the invention to provide a filter surface whose properties make a high rate of occupation by unit of area of the catalytically active centers possible, preferably permanently or for as long as possible.
the requirements with regard to the pore structure or the real surface of the suitable carrier materials are low compared with those of heterogeneous gas catalysts. nanoporous carrier structures with pore diameters of less than 20 nm are not suitable, since, because of the size distribution of the particulates (dp>20 nm) in the exhaust gases, these particles cannot enter the pore system. therefore, if a catalyst were located there it would not add to the catalytic oxidation of particulates.
the carrier surface of the filter body according to the invention is only oriented on the boundary layer between the gas space and the carrier material which is accessible for the particulates. this so-called separation surface essentially does not differ from the actually available geometric boundary surface of the particle filters adjoining the gas space.

in the last several decades, the continuous development of diesel engines for vehicles having a maximum allowable total weight of under 2.5 tons led to an ever greater reduction in the emission of pollutants. thanks to the introduction of improved fuel injection technologies and/or an exhaust gas recirculation, modern diesel engines for small trucks and passenger cars only emit about 0.5 g/km of particulates, as well as around 100 ppm of nitrogen oxides in the partial load range. the current rate of development suggests, however, that the optimum with regard to the level of both pollutants in the exhaust gas has been reached, since any further attempt to lower the amount of one of the two components through design modifications of the diesel engine automatically leads to an increase in the production of the other pollutant. for the year 2005, however, the eu plans to drastically further lower the limiting value for this kind of diesel vehicles to 0.25 g/km for nitrogen oxides and 0.025 g/km for particles. in order to comply with these emission limits, a suitable secondary treatment of the exhaust gases is required. at present, efforts concentrate on the reduction of particulates from the exhaust gases since the emission of the nitrogen oxides already comes very close to the planned upper limiting value.
particulate filters which, depending on their constructive design, filter out up to 95 wt-% of the carbon-particulate matter are an effective method for the reduction of particulates from the diesel exhaust gases. so-called wall-flow filters with a honeycomb-like structure in which their flow channels are alternatively blocked so that the exhaust gas must flow through the porous filter walls, are widely used.
however, the filters become blocked when the load of particulates increases, which leads to an increase in flow resistance and, correspondingly, to a reduction in engine performance. in order to counteract this blocking, the filters must, continually or in cyclical intervals, be freed of the carbon-particulate matter. the regeneration methods used at present in particle filters are based on thermal combustion, catalytic processes or on a combination of both methods.
for a purely thermal regeneration, temperatures in excess of 600Â° c. are required, temperatures which, however, the exhaust gas only reaches under few operating conditions of the engine. therefore, either fuel-driven burners or electrically powered heating elements are used in this kind of cleaning, as can be seen in printed publications de 19810738 c1 or de 4110395 a1.
because of the high energy demand of a purely thermal regeneration, additives which can lower the ignition temperature of the settled particulates down to 400Â° c. are also used in the fuel in certain methods. for example, psa peugeot citroÃ«n describes a process in which an organic cerium compound is continually mixed with the fuel. this procedure effects a corresponding metal oxide enrichment of the carbon-particulate matter which is removed from the exhaust gases on a particle filter. regeneration takes place in cyclical intervals by a short-term increase of the exhaust gas temperature to over 450Â° c., which leads to a burn-off of the filter-bound carbon-particulate matter which has been thus ?œactivated?? in order to reach this ignition temperature in the regeneration cycle, a relatively large amount of fuel is injected into the combustion chamber which effects an increase in hydrocarbon emission in the exhaust gases. this increase in concentration is calculated so that its oxidation in a platinum catalyst preceding the particle filter leads to a heating of the exhaust gas up to the regeneration temperature.
further thermal regeneration methods are based on generating nitrogen dioxide as an oxidant for the filter-bound soot. for example, ep 341832 b1 and ep 1055805 a1 describe devices which consist of an oxidation catalyst for converting nitrogen oxide no into nitrogen dioxide no2 by means of residual oxygen in the exhaust gases, and a subsequent particle filter. in this case, the burn-off of the carbon-particulate matter occurs in a continuous manner even at temperatures below 400Â° c. if a sufficient concentration of nitrogen oxide is present in the exhaust gases. if necessary, the combustion of the carbon-particulate matter is supported by a suitable catalytic coating of the filter surface, as can bee seen from printed publications ep 0341832 a1 or wo 01/12320 a1, or from ep 0758713. the purely catalytic methods described are so-called self-cleaning of self-regenerating particle filters, which only oxidizes the surface-bound carbon-particulate matter because of a catalytic coating of the filter. printed publication u.s. pat. no. 6,013,599 describes an oxidation catalyst for particulates on the basis of mixed oxides which consists of the metal oxides of copper, iron and vanadium which, from an exhaust gas temperature of 380Â° c. upwards, leads to a cleaning of the filter-bound carbon-particulate matter. printed publication u.s. pat. no. 5,100,632 also discloses a self-cleaning diesel particulate filter, in which the ignition temperature of the carbon-particulate matter is lowered to 355Â° c. by a combination of a platinum/rhodium coating of the filter surface with an alkaline earth metal oxide.
therefore, in all known regeneration methods, exhaust gas temperatures in excess of 355Â° c. are required in order to keep the particulate filter clear. since these cannot be reached in many operating conditions of modern diesel engines, these methods are only suitable to a limited extent for the practical use in vehicles with a maximum allowable total weight of under 2.5 tons. furthermore, all methods with an external application of energy into the exhaust gas system generally lower the degree of efficiency of the engine.
therefore, it is the object of the invention to provide a filter which can be regenerated at comparatively lower exhaust gas temperatures. a further subject matter of the invention is the creation of a method for the production of the device.
the object of the invention is achieved by a device comprising the characterizing features of the first claim and the dependent claim. advantageous embodiments arise from the dependent features. a production method as well as an advantageous manner of use arise from the corresponding dependent claims.
according to the invention, the object is achieved by a particulate filter comprising an open-pored body as a particle filter and a finely dispersed catalyst. a finely dispersed catalyst according to the invention is present when particulates cannot settle between two catalytically active centers. the fine dispersion on the surface of the body therefore results in an intensive contact between particulates which have settled thereon and the catalyst. in this way, a continuous oxidation of the carbon-particulate matter by the oxidants of the exhaust gases can be achieved from as low an exhaust gas temperature as 150Â° c. furthermore, in principle, it is possible in this way that the catalyst may also take effect by using the residual oxygen of the exhaust gases.
the invention is based on the observation that the reaction capacity of an oxidation catalyst for diesel particulates settled in open-pored bodies increased corresponding to an increase of density by area of the catalytically active centers on the boundary surface accessible to the particulates which adjoins the gas space. this observation was supported by the knowledge that particulates which have settled on surfaces remain on the location of settling (in contrast to gas molecules) and cannot be sufficiently mobilized even by taking process engineering measures. therefore, in catalytic particulate oxidation, the effective cross-section of the catalytically active centers in relation to area is much smaller than in heterogeneous gas catalysis, since the basic way in which a catalyst functions is based on direct contact with the participants in a reaction. in order to ensure sufficient particulate reaction activity, a fine dispersion of the catalyst is provided on the boundary surface accessible to the particulates which adjoins the gas space. a preferred dispersion has therefore been attained when the average distance of the individual catalytically active centers in relation to each other does just about not exceed the diameter of the smallest settled particulate unit (the so-called primary particulate structure). in that case, particulates cannot settle between catalyst material without coming into contact with the catalyst. if a particulate were able to settle on the body without having contact with the catalyst material, it would hardly be removable by catalysis.
since at present the size of the so-called primary particulate structures in the exhaust gases is between 20 and 30 nm, a correspondingly finely dispersed catalyst coating would be the aim. the distance between two catalytically active centers would, in that case, generally not exceed 20 nm in order to be able to remove completely, by catalysis, the particulates settling on the body.
as well as the noble metals pt, pd, rh, re, or ru, or transition-metal oxides, such as e.g. v2o5, ceo2, la2o3, mno2, cuo, and mixtures or mixed oxides from and containing these compounds, all known types of catalyst which oxidize particulates are considered suitable.
however, catalysts are preferred which at least partially consist of noble metal oxides, in particular rhodium oxide rh2o3, or which consist of oxides of yttrium and manganese or of mixed oxides from and containing these compounds, in particular yttrium manganite ymn2o5. finely dispersed, these compounds showed the highest capacity for oxidizing carbon-particulate matter, and, in contrast to known noble metals and transition-metal oxides, did so even utilizing the residual oxygen content of the exhaust gases. this capacity for oxidizing carbon-particulate matter already began at a temperature of under 150Â° c. surprisingly, these catalysts showed very little activity when tested for their capacity for oxidizing hydrocarbons.
in the presence of about 300 ppm nitrogen oxide in the particulate-loaded reaction gas, the specific particulate oxidation activity of these catalysts nearly doubled, so that a finely dispersed diesel particulate catalyst is preferably to be mounted, within the exhaust system, behind a nitrogen monoxide oxidation catalyst for generating nitrogen dioxide.
basically, all open-pored bodies and fills made of ceramic and metallic material, or combinations of both, which have a high removal capacity for particulates over the total size range from dp=3 nm to dp=10 Î¼m and allow a fine dispersion of the catalyst on the surface, are considered suitable for the device according to the invention.
advantageously, a so-called depth filter is used, which in comparison to surface filters has a greater filter surface accessible to particulates. the filter body can be kept free continually when a depth filter is used. advantageously, a so-called depth filter is used, which in comparison to surface filters has a greater surface which can be occupied by large particulates (with a diameter of dp>100 nm). this advantage is based on the different designs of the pore structure in the two filter types. in depth filters, the open pore system is designed so that even the larger particulates can be removed deep within the filter body, whereby the effect of the filter extends over the total volume or the total surface of the filter. in surface filters, the pore structure which is a consequence of the design prevents penetration of these large particulates into the filter body, so that, to the greater extent, only the smaller outer part of the filter surface is occupied by the particulates. the intended fast formation of a filter cake associated with this process would make it difficult to keep a surface filter continually free by means of a finely dispersed particulate catalyst coating.
preferably, the filter is combined with an electric heater. in particular, the electrical heater known from printed publication de 19718239 a1 is used to eliminate reliably the blocking of the finely dispersed diesel catalyst in cases of emergency or under unfavorable operating conditions of the diesel engine, for example, a cold start.
in some cases, depending on the particulate load of the diesel exhaust gases or the desired filter efficiency, the combination of a depth filter with a subsequent surface filter which are both coated with catalyst material in a finely dispersed manner may be a preferable embodiment of the device according to the invention. by this measure, depending on the open porosity the individual modules are set to, a well directed fractionated removal of the particles is possible, which, if dimensioned favorably, results in an increase of the total degree of efficiency of the filter while at the same time minimizing the loss of pressure over the total extent of the filter.
it is the aim of the invention to provide a filter surface whose properties make a high rate of occupation by unit of area of the catalytically active centers possible, preferably permanently or for as long as possible.
the requirements with regard to the pore structure or the real surface of the suitable carrier materials are low compared with those of heterogeneous gas catalysts. nanoporous carrier structures with pore diameters of less than 20 nm are not suitable, since, because of the size distribution of the particulates (dp>20 nm) in the exhaust gases, these particles cannot enter the pore system. therefore, if a catalyst were located there it would not add to the catalytic oxidation of particulates.
the carrier surface of the filter body according to the invention is only oriented on the boundary layer between the gas space and the carrier material which is accessible for the particulates. this so-called separation surface essentially does not differ from the actually available geometric boundary surface of the particle filters adjoining the gas space.
with regard to selection and spatial configuration of the carrier material, those measures are advantageous which contribute to maximizing the specific boundary surface carrying the catalyst. such measures include optimization of surface roughness or the generation of open Î¼m-pores close to the surface.
thus, the known wash-coat processes are only suitable to a limited extent for producing the finely dispersed diesel particulate catalyst of the invention, since precursor compounds of the catalysts such as, e.g., water-soluble salts of noble metals, together with suitable ceramic powders, are applied to the carrier surfaces in the form of a suspension. after the coating has solidified and has been fixed by a calcination step, the catalyst is now activated and dispersed over the whole resulting thickness of the layer, therefore being, at least partially, inaccessible to the particulates. therefore, in order to achieve a fine dispersion of the catalytically active centers on the separation surface according to the invention, the concentration, in the coating suspension, of the compounds forming the catalyst must be strongly increased. such a measure is only feasible to a limited extent for reasons based on coating technology, as well as when noble metals are used.
therefore, a method is preferred in which the catalyst particles are directly applied to the surface of a particle filter, in particular, these are pre-shaped and/or of nano scale, i.e. with diameters smaller than 100 nm. therefore, the application, for example, is effected by using?”in particular nano disperse?”catalyst-colloid-coating solutions, which, for example, have been produced by using sol-gel technology or by a synthesis by means of micro- and miniemulsions.
in order to improve the fine dispersion of the catalyst particles onto the filter surface or the dosing of the amount of catalyst, it is advantageous to put opposite electric charges on the particles as well as on the filter boundary surfaces. as an auxiliary means for charging, all surface-active ionic compounds (such as, for example, polydiallyldimethylammoniumchloride or polyacrylic acid are considered suitable, which can be applied to the respective surface with enough adhesion, and which can be removed from the border surface by means of a calcination, leaving little residue.
in order to improve the effectiveness of the regeneration, additional oxygen is introduced into the filter during operation. ozone, which is particularly reactive, is to be preferred.",4,problem,reduction in engine performance,1.0,exact,-1

further thermal regeneration methods are based on generating nitrogen dioxide as an oxidant for the filter-bound soot. for example, ep 341832 b1 and ep 1055805 a1 describe devices which consist of an oxidation catalyst for converting nitrogen oxide no into nitrogen dioxide no2 by means of residual oxygen in the exhaust gases, and a subsequent particle filter. in this case, the burn-off of the carbon-particulate matter occurs in a continuous manner even at temperatures below 400Â° c. if a sufficient concentration of nitrogen oxide is present in the exhaust gases. if necessary, the combustion of the carbon-particulate matter is supported by a suitable catalytic coating of the filter surface, as can bee seen from printed publications ep 0341832 a1 or wo 01/12320 a1, or from ep 0758713. the purely catalytic methods described are so-called self-cleaning of self-regenerating particle filters, which only oxidizes the surface-bound carbon-particulate matter because of a catalytic coating of the filter. printed publication u.s. pat. no. 6,013,599 describes an oxidation catalyst for particulates on the basis of mixed oxides which consists of the metal oxides of copper, iron and vanadium which, from an exhaust gas temperature of 380Â° c. upwards, leads to a cleaning of the filter-bound carbon-particulate matter. printed publication u.s. pat. no. 5,100,632 also discloses a self-cleaning diesel particulate filter, in which the ignition temperature of the carbon-particulate matter is lowered to 355Â° c. by a combination of a platinum/rhodium coating of the filter surface with an alkaline earth metal oxide.
therefore, in all known regeneration methods, exhaust gas temperatures in excess of 355Â° c. are required in order to keep the particulate filter clear. since these cannot be reached in many operating conditions of modern diesel engines, these methods are only suitable to a limited extent for the practical use in vehicles with a maximum allowable total weight of under 2.5 tons. furthermore, all methods with an external application of energy into the exhaust gas system generally lower the degree of efficiency of the engine.
therefore, it is the object of the invention to provide a filter which can be regenerated at comparatively lower exhaust gas temperatures. a further subject matter of the invention is the creation of a method for the production of the device.
the object of the invention is achieved by a device comprising the characterizing features of the first claim and the dependent claim. advantageous embodiments arise from the dependent features. a production method as well as an advantageous manner of use arise from the corresponding dependent claims.
according to the invention, the object is achieved by a particulate filter comprising an open-pored body as a particle filter and a finely dispersed catalyst. a finely dispersed catalyst according to the invention is present when particulates cannot settle between two catalytically active centers. the fine dispersion on the surface of the body therefore results in an intensive contact between particulates which have settled thereon and the catalyst. in this way, a continuous oxidation of the carbon-particulate matter by the oxidants of the exhaust gases can be achieved from as low an exhaust gas temperature as 150Â° c. furthermore, in principle, it is possible in this way that the catalyst may also take effect by using the residual oxygen of the exhaust gases.
the invention is based on the observation that the reaction capacity of an oxidation catalyst for diesel particulates settled in open-pored bodies increased corresponding to an increase of density by area of the catalytically active centers on the boundary surface accessible to the particulates which adjoins the gas space. this observation was supported by the knowledge that particulates which have settled on surfaces remain on the location of settling (in contrast to gas molecules) and cannot be sufficiently mobilized even by taking process engineering measures. therefore, in catalytic particulate oxidation, the effective cross-section of the catalytically active centers in relation to area is much smaller than in heterogeneous gas catalysis, since the basic way in which a catalyst functions is based on direct contact with the participants in a reaction. in order to ensure sufficient particulate reaction activity, a fine dispersion of the catalyst is provided on the boundary surface accessible to the particulates which adjoins the gas space. a preferred dispersion has therefore been attained when the average distance of the individual catalytically active centers in relation to each other does just about not exceed the diameter of the smallest settled particulate unit (the so-called primary particulate structure). in that case, particulates cannot settle between catalyst material without coming into contact with the catalyst. if a particulate were able to settle on the body without having contact with the catalyst material, it would hardly be removable by catalysis.
since at present the size of the so-called primary particulate structures in the exhaust gases is between 20 and 30 nm, a correspondingly finely dispersed catalyst coating would be the aim. the distance between two catalytically active centers would, in that case, generally not exceed 20 nm in order to be able to remove completely, by catalysis, the particulates settling on the body.
as well as the noble metals pt, pd, rh, re, or ru, or transition-metal oxides, such as e.g. v2o5, ceo2, la2o3, mno2, cuo, and mixtures or mixed oxides from and containing these compounds, all known types of catalyst which oxidize particulates are considered suitable.
however, catalysts are preferred which at least partially consist of noble metal oxides, in particular rhodium oxide rh2o3, or which consist of oxides of yttrium and manganese or of mixed oxides from and containing these compounds, in particular yttrium manganite ymn2o5. finely dispersed, these compounds showed the highest capacity for oxidizing carbon-particulate matter, and, in contrast to known noble metals and transition-metal oxides, did so even utilizing the residual oxygen content of the exhaust gases. this capacity for oxidizing carbon-particulate matter already began at a temperature of under 150Â° c. surprisingly, these catalysts showed very little activity when tested for their capacity for oxidizing hydrocarbons.
in the presence of about 300 ppm nitrogen oxide in the particulate-loaded reaction gas, the specific particulate oxidation activity of these catalysts nearly doubled, so that a finely dispersed diesel particulate catalyst is preferably to be mounted, within the exhaust system, behind a nitrogen monoxide oxidation catalyst for generating nitrogen dioxide.
basically, all open-pored bodies and fills made of ceramic and metallic material, or combinations of both, which have a high removal capacity for particulates over the total size range from dp=3 nm to dp=10 Î¼m and allow a fine dispersion of the catalyst on the surface, are considered suitable for the device according to the invention.
advantageously, a so-called depth filter is used, which in comparison to surface filters has a greater filter surface accessible to particulates. the filter body can be kept free continually when a depth filter is used. advantageously, a so-called depth filter is used, which in comparison to surface filters has a greater surface which can be occupied by large particulates (with a diameter of dp>100 nm). this advantage is based on the different designs of the pore structure in the two filter types. in depth filters, the open pore system is designed so that even the larger particulates can be removed deep within the filter body, whereby the effect of the filter extends over the total volume or the total surface of the filter. in surface filters, the pore structure which is a consequence of the design prevents penetration of these large particulates into the filter body, so that, to the greater extent, only the smaller outer part of the filter surface is occupied by the particulates. the intended fast formation of a filter cake associated with this process would make it difficult to keep a surface filter continually free by means of a finely dispersed particulate catalyst coating.
preferably, the filter is combined with an electric heater. in particular, the electrical heater known from printed publication de 19718239 a1 is used to eliminate reliably the blocking of the finely dispersed diesel catalyst in cases of emergency or under unfavorable operating conditions of the diesel engine, for example, a cold start.
in some cases, depending on the particulate load of the diesel exhaust gases or the desired filter efficiency, the combination of a depth filter with a subsequent surface filter which are both coated with catalyst material in a finely dispersed manner may be a preferable embodiment of the device according to the invention. by this measure, depending on the open porosity the individual modules are set to, a well directed fractionated removal of the particles is possible, which, if dimensioned favorably, results in an increase of the total degree of efficiency of the filter while at the same time minimizing the loss of pressure over the total extent of the filter.
it is the aim of the invention to provide a filter surface whose properties make a high rate of occupation by unit of area of the catalytically active centers possible, preferably permanently or for as long as possible.
the requirements with regard to the pore structure or the real surface of the suitable carrier materials are low compared with those of heterogeneous gas catalysts. nanoporous carrier structures with pore diameters of less than 20 nm are not suitable, since, because of the size distribution of the particulates (dp>20 nm) in the exhaust gases, these particles cannot enter the pore system. therefore, if a catalyst were located there it would not add to the catalytic oxidation of particulates.
the carrier surface of the filter body according to the invention is only oriented on the boundary layer between the gas space and the carrier material which is accessible for the particulates. this so-called separation surface essentially does not differ from the actually available geometric boundary surface of the particle filters adjoining the gas space.
with regard to selection and spatial configuration of the carrier material, those measures are advantageous which contribute to maximizing the specific boundary surface carrying the catalyst. such measures include optimization of surface roughness or the generation of open Î¼m-pores close to the surface.
thus, the known wash-coat processes are only suitable to a limited extent for producing the finely dispersed diesel particulate catalyst of the invention, since precursor compounds of the catalysts such as, e.g., water-soluble salts of noble metals, together with suitable ceramic powders, are applied to the carrier surfaces in the form of a suspension. after the coating has solidified and has been fixed by a calcination step, the catalyst is now activated and dispersed over the whole resulting thickness of the layer, therefore being, at least partially, inaccessible to the particulates. therefore, in order to achieve a fine dispersion of the catalytically active centers on the separation surface according to the invention, the concentration, in the coating suspension, of the compounds forming the catalyst must be strongly increased. such a measure is only feasible to a limited extent for reasons based on coating technology, as well as when noble metals are used.
therefore, a method is preferred in which the catalyst particles are directly applied to the surface of a particle filter, in particular, these are pre-shaped and/or of nano scale, i.e. with diameters smaller than 100 nm. therefore, the application, for example, is effected by using?”in particular nano disperse?”catalyst-colloid-coating solutions, which, for example, have been produced by using sol-gel technology or by a synthesis by means of micro- and miniemulsions.
in order to improve the fine dispersion of the catalyst particles onto the filter surface or the dosing of the amount of catalyst, it is advantageous to put opposite electric charges on the particles as well as on the filter boundary surfaces. as an auxiliary means for charging, all surface-active ionic compounds (such as, for example, polydiallyldimethylammoniumchloride or polyacrylic acid are considered suitable, which can be applied to the respective surface with enough adhesion, and which can be removed from the border surface by means of a calcination, leaving little residue.
in order to improve the effectiveness of the regeneration, additional oxygen is introduced into the filter during operation. ozone, which is particularly reactive, is to be preferred.",6,problem,exhaust gas temperatures in excess of 355Â° c.,1.0,exact,0
US07666376,diesel particulate filter comprising a finely dispersed diesel particulate catalyst,"the invention relates to a device for the, (in particular continuous), oxidation of particulates from the exhaust gases of diesel motors. said device consists of an open-pored body as a particle filter, on whose surface an oxidation catalyst is finely dispersed. the device is characterized in that from an exhaust gas temperature as low as 150Â° c., the catalyst causes the oxidation of particulates attached to the filter using the residual oxygen of the exhaust gas, thus keeping the filter body continuously free of particulates during almost all the operating conditions of the motor.","the invention relates to a particulate filter comprising a particulate catalyst, a method for producing the particulate filter as well its use.
known diesel particulate filters comprise catalysts by means of which a blocking of the filter is counteracted. such catalysts are called diesel particulate catalysts. particulate catalysts from the exhaust gases of diesel engines settle on or in a filter, which consists of an open-pored body as a particle filter. a catalyst is applied hereon. by means of the catalyst, the particulates are, for example, oxidized.
in the last several decades, the continuous development of diesel engines for vehicles having a maximum allowable total weight of under 2.5 tons led to an ever greater reduction in the emission of pollutants. thanks to the introduction of improved fuel injection technologies and/or an exhaust gas recirculation, modern diesel engines for small trucks and passenger cars only emit about 0.5 g/km of particulates, as well as around 100 ppm of nitrogen oxides in the partial load range. the current rate of development suggests, however, that the optimum with regard to the level of both pollutants in the exhaust gas has been reached, since any further attempt to lower the amount of one of the two components through design modifications of the diesel engine automatically leads to an increase in the production of the other pollutant. for the year 2005, however, the eu plans to drastically further lower the limiting value for this kind of diesel vehicles to 0.25 g/km for nitrogen oxides and 0.025 g/km for particles. in order to comply with these emission limits, a suitable secondary treatment of the exhaust gases is required. at present, efforts concentrate on the reduction of particulates from the exhaust gases since the emission of the nitrogen oxides already comes very close to the planned upper limiting value.
particulate filters which, depending on their constructive design, filter out up to 95 wt-% of the carbon-particulate matter are an effective method for the reduction of particulates from the diesel exhaust gases. so-called wall-flow filters with a honeycomb-like structure in which their flow channels are alternatively blocked so that the exhaust gas must flow through the porous filter walls, are widely used.
however, the filters become blocked when the load of particulates increases, which leads to an increase in flow resistance and, correspondingly, to a reduction in engine performance. in order to counteract this blocking, the filters must, continually or in cyclical intervals, be freed of the carbon-particulate matter. the regeneration methods used at present in particle filters are based on thermal combustion, catalytic processes or on a combination of both methods.
for a purely thermal regeneration, temperatures in excess of 600Â° c. are required, temperatures which, however, the exhaust gas only reaches under few operating conditions of the engine. therefore, either fuel-driven burners or electrically powered heating elements are used in this kind of cleaning, as can be seen in printed publications de 19810738 c1 or de 4110395 a1.

US07669408,lnt desulfation strategy with reformer temperature management,"desulfation methods for an exhaust treatment system having a fuel reformer configured upstream of a lnt. reductant is injected upstream of the fuel reformer. the reductant reacts within the reformer to generate heat, but the system is configured for some reductant to breakthrough and react in the lnt to generate further heat. this configuration allows the lnt to operate at temperatures higher the than first device and facilitates independent control of the lnt and first device temperatures. an outer loop controls the lnt temperature by issuing instructions to an inner loop that controls the reformer. typically, the inner loop will pulse the reductant injection rate in order to limit the reformer temperature. the outer loop can pulses the loop on a longer time scale, resulting in two pulse periods. through timing, a reformate peak from one period is made to overlap a temperature peak from a previous period.","the present invention relates to pollution control systems and methods for diesel and lean burn gasoline engines.
nox emissions from diesel engines are an environmental problem. several countries, including the united states, have long had regulations pending that will limit nox emissions from trucks and other diesel-powered vehicles. manufacturers and researchers have put considerable effort toward meeting those regulations.
in gasoline powered vehicles that use stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures, three-way catalysts have been shown to control nox emissions. in diesel-powered vehicles, which use compression ignition, the exhaust is generally too oxygen-rich for three-way catalysts to be effective.
several solutions have been proposed for controlling nox emissions from diesel-powered vehicles. one set of approaches focuses on the engine. techniques such as exhaust gas recirculation and partially homogenizing fuel-air mixtures are helpful, but these techniques alone will not eliminate nox emissions. another set of approaches remove nox from the vehicle exhaust. these include the use of lean-burn nox catalysts, selective catalytic reduction (scr), and lean nox traps (lnts).
lean-burn nox catalysts promote the reduction of nox under oxygen-rich conditions. reduction of nox in an oxidizing atmosphere is difficult. it has proven challenging to find a lean-burn nox catalyst that has the required activity, durability, and operating temperature range. lean-burn nox catalysts also tend to be hydrothermally unstable. a noticeable loss of activity occurs after relatively little use. lean-burn nox catalysts typically employ a zeolite wash coat, which is thought to provide a reducing microenvironment. the introduction of a reductant, such as diesel fuel, into the exhaust is generally required and introduces a fuel economy penalty of 3% or more. currently, peak nox conversion efficiencies for lean-burn catalysts are unacceptably low.
scr generally refers to selective catalytic reduction of nox by ammonia. the reaction takes place even in an oxidizing environment. the nox can be temporarily stored in an absorbent or ammonia can be fed continuously into the exhaust. scr can achieve high levels of nox reduction, but there is a disadvantage in the lack of infrastructure for distributing ammonia or a suitable precursor. another concern relates to the possible release of ammonia into the environment.
lnts are devices with nox absorbents and catalysts that reduce nox during regeneration. the absorbent is typically an alkaline earth oxide absorbent, such as baco3 and the catalyst is typically a precious metal, such as pt or ru. in lean exhaust, the catalyst speeds oxidizing reactions that lead to nox adsorption. accumulated nox is removed and the lnt is regenerated by creating a reducing environment within the lnt. in a reducing environment, the catalyst activates reactions by which adsorbed nox is reduced and desorbed.
a lnt can produce ammonia during denitration. accordingly, it has been proposed to combine a lnt and an ammonia scr catalyst into one system. ammonia produced by the lnt during regeneration is captured by the scr catalyst for subsequent use in reducing nox, thereby improving conversion efficiency over a stand-alone lnt with no increase in fuel penalty or precious metal usage. u.s. pat. no. 6,732,507 describes such a system. u.s. pat. pub. no. 2004/0076565describes such systems wherein both components are contained within a single shell or disbursed over one substrate. wo 2004/090296 describes such a system wherein there is an inline reformer upstream of the lnt and the scr catalyst.
creating a reducing environment for lnt regeneration involves eliminating most of the oxygen from the exhaust and providing a reducing agent. except where the engine can be run stoichiometric or rich, a portion of the reductant reacts within the exhaust to consume oxygen. the amount of oxygen to be removed by reaction with reductant can be reduced in various ways. if the engine is equipped with an intake air throttle, the throttle can be used. the transmission gear ratio can be changed to shift the engine to an operating point that produces equal power but contains less oxygen. however, at least in the case of a diesel engine, it is generally necessary to eliminate some of the oxygen in the exhaust by combustion or reforming reactions with reductant that is injected into the exhaust.
reductant can be injected into the exhaust by the engine or a separate fuel injection device. for example, the engine can inject extra fuel into the exhaust within one or more cylinders prior to expelling the exhaust. alternatively, or in addition, reductant can be injected into the exhaust downstream of the engine.
the reactions between reductant and oxygen can take place in the lnt, although it is generally preferred for the reactions to occur in a catalyst upstream of the lnt, whereby the heat of reaction does not cause large temperature increase within the lnt at every regeneration.
in addition to accumulating nox, lnts accumulate sox. sox is the combustion product of sulfur present in ordinarily fuel. even with reduced sulfur fuels, the amount of sox produced by combustion is significant. sox adsorbs more strongly than nox and necessitates a more stringent, though less frequent, regeneration. desulfation requires elevated temperatures as well as a reducing atmosphere. the temperature of the exhaust can be elevated by engine measures, particularly in the case of a lean-burn gasoline engine, however, at least in the case of a diesel engine, it is often necessary to provide additional heat. typically, this heat is provided through the same types of reactions as used to remove excess oxygen from the exhaust.
u.s. pat. no. 6,832,473 describes a system wherein the reductant is reformate produced outside the exhaust stream and injected into the exhaust as needed. during desulfations, the reformate is injected upstream of an oxidation catalyst. heat generated by combustion of the reformate over the oxidation catalyst is carried by the exhaust to the lnt and raises the lnt to desulfations temperatures.
u.s. pat. pub. no. 2003/0101713 describes an exhaust treatment system with a fuel reformer placed in the exhaust line upstream of a lnt. the reformer includes both oxidation and reforming catalysts. the reformer both removes excess oxygen and converts the diesel fuel reductant into more reactive reformate. for desulfations, heat produced by the reformer is used to raise the lnt to desulfations temperatures. the diesel fuel injection may be pulsed to control the reformer temperature.
in spite of advances, there continues to be a long felt need for an affordable and reliable exhaust treatment system that is durable, has a manageable operating cost (including fuel penalty), and is practical for reducing nox emissions from diesel engines to a satisfactory extent in the sense of meeting u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) regulations effective in 2010 and other such regulations.
several of the inventors' concepts relates to methods of desulfating a lnt. the methods generally apply to a system in which a first device, which may be a fuel reformer, is placed upstream of the lnt in an exhaust treatment system. reductant is injected upstream of the first device. much of the reductant is oxidized and/or reformed in the first device and generates heat there.
according to one of the inventors' concepts for desulfating a lnt, a significant additional portion of the reductant and/or reformed products thereof react within the lnt to generate further heat. typically, the lnt temperature is thereby raised to a peak that is at least about 100Â° c. higher than the temperature of the exhaust entering the lnt. this concept allows the lnt to operate at higher temperatures than the first device and facilitates independent control of the lnt and first device temperatures in conjunction with methods described below.
another concept relates to a control strategy that applies to the above-described system. an outer loop controls the lnt temperature by issuing instructions to an inner loop that controls the first device. the instructions involve, for example, switching modes for the inner loop (e.g., between on and off modes). the inner loop controls the first device temperature through control at least over the reductant injection rate. typically, the inner loop will pulse the reductant injection rate in order to limit the first device temperature. the outer loop can pulse the operation of the inner loop to independently control the temperature of the lnt.
a similar concept also relates to a method of desulfating a lnt in an exhaust aftertreatment system comprising a first device upstream of the lnt. the method comprises controlling a temperature of the lnt to within a first range by varying a supply of diesel fuel to the exhaust upstream of the first device. the control strategy comprising two modes of diesel fuel supply, a first mode of which comprises supplying diesel fuel in a manner that regulates the temperature of the first catalyst to within a second range having a minimum and a maximum, and a second mode in which the diesel fuel supply is substantially terminated, whereby the temperature of the first device falls below the minimum of the second range.
a further concept relates to a control strategy for desulfation that involves reductant injection that is intermittent on two time scales, one shorter and one longer. the intermittency on the longer time scale is generally used to control the temperature of an lnt. the intermittency on the shorter time scale is generally used to control the temperature of an upstream device, the first device referred to above, which is typically a fuel reformer.
a still further concept also relates to a desulfation control strategy for an exhaust treatment system having a first device upstream of a lnt and a reductant supply upstream of the first device. according to this strategy, the reductant supply is pulsed to control the temperature of the lnt. the pulse periods and durations are selected whereby reductant is provided to the lnt while the lnt temperature is still near a peak resulting from combustion of reductant injected during the previous pulse. a portion of the reductant, pyrolyzed, or reformed products thereof, maybe stored in the lnt during periods or reductant injection and may combust during periods of no reductant injection when the oxygen concentration within the lnt increases. if the lnt temperature varies over each pulse period between a minimum and a maximum differing by at least about 50Â° c., the lnt temperature will generally be within about 25Â° c. of the maximum at the onset of reductant injection.

nox emissions from diesel engines are an environmental problem. several countries, including the united states, have long had regulations pending that will limit nox emissions from trucks and other diesel-powered vehicles. manufacturers and researchers have put considerable effort toward meeting those regulations.
in gasoline powered vehicles that use stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures, three-way catalysts have been shown to control nox emissions. in diesel-powered vehicles, which use compression ignition, the exhaust is generally too oxygen-rich for three-way catalysts to be effective.
several solutions have been proposed for controlling nox emissions from diesel-powered vehicles. one set of approaches focuses on the engine. techniques such as exhaust gas recirculation and partially homogenizing fuel-air mixtures are helpful, but these techniques alone will not eliminate nox emissions. another set of approaches remove nox from the vehicle exhaust. these include the use of lean-burn nox catalysts, selective catalytic reduction (scr), and lean nox traps (lnts).
lean-burn nox catalysts promote the reduction of nox under oxygen-rich conditions. reduction of nox in an oxidizing atmosphere is difficult. it has proven challenging to find a lean-burn nox catalyst that has the required activity, durability, and operating temperature range. lean-burn nox catalysts also tend to be hydrothermally unstable. a noticeable loss of activity occurs after relatively little use. lean-burn nox catalysts typically employ a zeolite wash coat, which is thought to provide a reducing microenvironment. the introduction of a reductant, such as diesel fuel, into the exhaust is generally required and introduces a fuel economy penalty of 3% or more. currently, peak nox conversion efficiencies for lean-burn catalysts are unacceptably low.
scr generally refers to selective catalytic reduction of nox by ammonia. the reaction takes place even in an oxidizing environment. the nox can be temporarily stored in an absorbent or ammonia can be fed continuously into the exhaust. scr can achieve high levels of nox reduction, but there is a disadvantage in the lack of infrastructure for distributing ammonia or a suitable precursor. another concern relates to the possible release of ammonia into the environment.
lnts are devices with nox absorbents and catalysts that reduce nox during regeneration. the absorbent is typically an alkaline earth oxide absorbent, such as baco3 and the catalyst is typically a precious metal, such as pt or ru. in lean exhaust, the catalyst speeds oxidizing reactions that lead to nox adsorption. accumulated nox is removed and the lnt is regenerated by creating a reducing environment within the lnt. in a reducing environment, the catalyst activates reactions by which adsorbed nox is reduced and desorbed.
a lnt can produce ammonia during denitration. accordingly, it has been proposed to combine a lnt and an ammonia scr catalyst into one system. ammonia produced by the lnt during regeneration is captured by the scr catalyst for subsequent use in reducing nox, thereby improving conversion efficiency over a stand-alone lnt with no increase in fuel penalty or precious metal usage. u.s. pat. no. 6,732,507 describes such a system. u.s. pat. pub. no. 2004/0076565describes such systems wherein both components are contained within a single shell or disbursed over one substrate. wo 2004/090296 describes such a system wherein there is an inline reformer upstream of the lnt and the scr catalyst.
creating a reducing environment for lnt regeneration involves eliminating most of the oxygen from the exhaust and providing a reducing agent. except where the engine can be run stoichiometric or rich, a portion of the reductant reacts within the exhaust to consume oxygen. the amount of oxygen to be removed by reaction with reductant can be reduced in various ways. if the engine is equipped with an intake air throttle, the throttle can be used. the transmission gear ratio can be changed to shift the engine to an operating point that produces equal power but contains less oxygen. however, at least in the case of a diesel engine, it is generally necessary to eliminate some of the oxygen in the exhaust by combustion or reforming reactions with reductant that is injected into the exhaust.
reductant can be injected into the exhaust by the engine or a separate fuel injection device. for example, the engine can inject extra fuel into the exhaust within one or more cylinders prior to expelling the exhaust. alternatively, or in addition, reductant can be injected into the exhaust downstream of the engine.
the reactions between reductant and oxygen can take place in the lnt, although it is generally preferred for the reactions to occur in a catalyst upstream of the lnt, whereby the heat of reaction does not cause large temperature increase within the lnt at every regeneration.
in addition to accumulating nox, lnts accumulate sox. sox is the combustion product of sulfur present in ordinarily fuel. even with reduced sulfur fuels, the amount of sox produced by combustion is significant. sox adsorbs more strongly than nox and necessitates a more stringent, though less frequent, regeneration. desulfation requires elevated temperatures as well as a reducing atmosphere. the temperature of the exhaust can be elevated by engine measures, particularly in the case of a lean-burn gasoline engine, however, at least in the case of a diesel engine, it is often necessary to provide additional heat. typically, this heat is provided through the same types of reactions as used to remove excess oxygen from the exhaust.
u.s. pat. no. 6,832,473 describes a system wherein the reductant is reformate produced outside the exhaust stream and injected into the exhaust as needed. during desulfations, the reformate is injected upstream of an oxidation catalyst. heat generated by combustion of the reformate over the oxidation catalyst is carried by the exhaust to the lnt and raises the lnt to desulfations temperatures.

another concept relates to a control strategy that applies to the above-described system. an outer loop controls the lnt temperature by issuing instructions to an inner loop that controls the first device. the instructions involve, for example, switching modes for the inner loop (e.g., between on and off modes). the inner loop controls the first device temperature through control at least over the reductant injection rate. typically, the inner loop will pulse the reductant injection rate in order to limit the first device temperature. the outer loop can pulse the operation of the inner loop to independently control the temperature of the lnt.
a similar concept also relates to a method of desulfating a lnt in an exhaust aftertreatment system comprising a first device upstream of the lnt. the method comprises controlling a temperature of the lnt to within a first range by varying a supply of diesel fuel to the exhaust upstream of the first device. the control strategy comprising two modes of diesel fuel supply, a first mode of which comprises supplying diesel fuel in a manner that regulates the temperature of the first catalyst to within a second range having a minimum and a maximum, and a second mode in which the diesel fuel supply is substantially terminated, whereby the temperature of the first device falls below the minimum of the second range.
a further concept relates to a control strategy for desulfation that involves reductant injection that is intermittent on two time scales, one shorter and one longer. the intermittency on the longer time scale is generally used to control the temperature of an lnt. the intermittency on the shorter time scale is generally used to control the temperature of an upstream device, the first device referred to above, which is typically a fuel reformer.
a still further concept also relates to a desulfation control strategy for an exhaust treatment system having a first device upstream of a lnt and a reductant supply upstream of the first device. according to this strategy, the reductant supply is pulsed to control the temperature of the lnt. the pulse periods and durations are selected whereby reductant is provided to the lnt while the lnt temperature is still near a peak resulting from combustion of reductant injected during the previous pulse. a portion of the reductant, pyrolyzed, or reformed products thereof, maybe stored in the lnt during periods or reductant injection and may combust during periods of no reductant injection when the oxygen concentration within the lnt increases. if the lnt temperature varies over each pulse period between a minimum and a maximum differing by at least about 50Â° c., the lnt temperature will generally be within about 25Â° c. of the maximum at the onset of reductant injection.

nox emissions from diesel engines are an environmental problem. several countries, including the united states, have long had regulations pending that will limit nox emissions from trucks and other diesel-powered vehicles. manufacturers and researchers have put considerable effort toward meeting those regulations.
in gasoline powered vehicles that use stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures, three-way catalysts have been shown to control nox emissions. in diesel-powered vehicles, which use compression ignition, the exhaust is generally too oxygen-rich for three-way catalysts to be effective.
several solutions have been proposed for controlling nox emissions from diesel-powered vehicles. one set of approaches focuses on the engine. techniques such as exhaust gas recirculation and partially homogenizing fuel-air mixtures are helpful, but these techniques alone will not eliminate nox emissions. another set of approaches remove nox from the vehicle exhaust. these include the use of lean-burn nox catalysts, selective catalytic reduction (scr), and lean nox traps (lnts).
lean-burn nox catalysts promote the reduction of nox under oxygen-rich conditions. reduction of nox in an oxidizing atmosphere is difficult. it has proven challenging to find a lean-burn nox catalyst that has the required activity, durability, and operating temperature range. lean-burn nox catalysts also tend to be hydrothermally unstable. a noticeable loss of activity occurs after relatively little use. lean-burn nox catalysts typically employ a zeolite wash coat, which is thought to provide a reducing microenvironment. the introduction of a reductant, such as diesel fuel, into the exhaust is generally required and introduces a fuel economy penalty of 3% or more. currently, peak nox conversion efficiencies for lean-burn catalysts are unacceptably low.
scr generally refers to selective catalytic reduction of nox by ammonia. the reaction takes place even in an oxidizing environment. the nox can be temporarily stored in an absorbent or ammonia can be fed continuously into the exhaust. scr can achieve high levels of nox reduction, but there is a disadvantage in the lack of infrastructure for distributing ammonia or a suitable precursor. another concern relates to the possible release of ammonia into the environment.
lnts are devices with nox absorbents and catalysts that reduce nox during regeneration. the absorbent is typically an alkaline earth oxide absorbent, such as baco3 and the catalyst is typically a precious metal, such as pt or ru. in lean exhaust, the catalyst speeds oxidizing reactions that lead to nox adsorption. accumulated nox is removed and the lnt is regenerated by creating a reducing environment within the lnt. in a reducing environment, the catalyst activates reactions by which adsorbed nox is reduced and desorbed.
a lnt can produce ammonia during denitration. accordingly, it has been proposed to combine a lnt and an ammonia scr catalyst into one system. ammonia produced by the lnt during regeneration is captured by the scr catalyst for subsequent use in reducing nox, thereby improving conversion efficiency over a stand-alone lnt with no increase in fuel penalty or precious metal usage. u.s. pat. no. 6,732,507 describes such a system. u.s. pat. pub. no. 2004/0076565describes such systems wherein both components are contained within a single shell or disbursed over one substrate. wo 2004/090296 describes such a system wherein there is an inline reformer upstream of the lnt and the scr catalyst.
creating a reducing environment for lnt regeneration involves eliminating most of the oxygen from the exhaust and providing a reducing agent. except where the engine can be run stoichiometric or rich, a portion of the reductant reacts within the exhaust to consume oxygen. the amount of oxygen to be removed by reaction with reductant can be reduced in various ways. if the engine is equipped with an intake air throttle, the throttle can be used. the transmission gear ratio can be changed to shift the engine to an operating point that produces equal power but contains less oxygen. however, at least in the case of a diesel engine, it is generally necessary to eliminate some of the oxygen in the exhaust by combustion or reforming reactions with reductant that is injected into the exhaust.
reductant can be injected into the exhaust by the engine or a separate fuel injection device. for example, the engine can inject extra fuel into the exhaust within one or more cylinders prior to expelling the exhaust. alternatively, or in addition, reductant can be injected into the exhaust downstream of the engine.
the reactions between reductant and oxygen can take place in the lnt, although it is generally preferred for the reactions to occur in a catalyst upstream of the lnt, whereby the heat of reaction does not cause large temperature increase within the lnt at every regeneration.
in addition to accumulating nox, lnts accumulate sox. sox is the combustion product of sulfur present in ordinarily fuel. even with reduced sulfur fuels, the amount of sox produced by combustion is significant. sox adsorbs more strongly than nox and necessitates a more stringent, though less frequent, regeneration. desulfation requires elevated temperatures as well as a reducing atmosphere. the temperature of the exhaust can be elevated by engine measures, particularly in the case of a lean-burn gasoline engine, however, at least in the case of a diesel engine, it is often necessary to provide additional heat. typically, this heat is provided through the same types of reactions as used to remove excess oxygen from the exhaust.
u.s. pat. no. 6,832,473 describes a system wherein the reductant is reformate produced outside the exhaust stream and injected into the exhaust as needed. during desulfations, the reformate is injected upstream of an oxidation catalyst. heat generated by combustion of the reformate over the oxidation catalyst is carried by the exhaust to the lnt and raises the lnt to desulfations temperatures.
u.s. pat. pub. no. 2003/0101713 describes an exhaust treatment system with a fuel reformer placed in the exhaust line upstream of a lnt. the reformer includes both oxidation and reforming catalysts. the reformer both removes excess oxygen and converts the diesel fuel reductant into more reactive reformate. for desulfations, heat produced by the reformer is used to raise the lnt to desulfations temperatures. the diesel fuel injection may be pulsed to control the reformer temperature.
in spite of advances, there continues to be a long felt need for an affordable and reliable exhaust treatment system that is durable, has a manageable operating cost (including fuel penalty), and is practical for reducing nox emissions from diesel engines to a satisfactory extent in the sense of meeting u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) regulations effective in 2010 and other such regulations.

a similar concept also relates to a method of desulfating a lnt in an exhaust aftertreatment system comprising a first device upstream of the lnt. the method comprises controlling a temperature of the lnt to within a first range by varying a supply of diesel fuel to the exhaust upstream of the first device. the control strategy comprising two modes of diesel fuel supply, a first mode of which comprises supplying diesel fuel in a manner that regulates the temperature of the first catalyst to within a second range having a minimum and a maximum, and a second mode in which the diesel fuel supply is substantially terminated, whereby the temperature of the first device falls below the minimum of the second range.
a further concept relates to a control strategy for desulfation that involves reductant injection that is intermittent on two time scales, one shorter and one longer. the intermittency on the longer time scale is generally used to control the temperature of an lnt. the intermittency on the shorter time scale is generally used to control the temperature of an upstream device, the first device referred to above, which is typically a fuel reformer.
a still further concept also relates to a desulfation control strategy for an exhaust treatment system having a first device upstream of a lnt and a reductant supply upstream of the first device. according to this strategy, the reductant supply is pulsed to control the temperature of the lnt. the pulse periods and durations are selected whereby reductant is provided to the lnt while the lnt temperature is still near a peak resulting from combustion of reductant injected during the previous pulse. a portion of the reductant, pyrolyzed, or reformed products thereof, maybe stored in the lnt during periods or reductant injection and may combust during periods of no reductant injection when the oxygen concentration within the lnt increases. if the lnt temperature varies over each pulse period between a minimum and a maximum differing by at least about 50Â° c., the lnt temperature will generally be within about 25Â° c. of the maximum at the onset of reductant injection.

nox emissions from diesel engines are an environmental problem. several countries, including the united states, have long had regulations pending that will limit nox emissions from trucks and other diesel-powered vehicles. manufacturers and researchers have put considerable effort toward meeting those regulations.
in gasoline powered vehicles that use stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures, three-way catalysts have been shown to control nox emissions. in diesel-powered vehicles, which use compression ignition, the exhaust is generally too oxygen-rich for three-way catalysts to be effective.
several solutions have been proposed for controlling nox emissions from diesel-powered vehicles. one set of approaches focuses on the engine. techniques such as exhaust gas recirculation and partially homogenizing fuel-air mixtures are helpful, but these techniques alone will not eliminate nox emissions. another set of approaches remove nox from the vehicle exhaust. these include the use of lean-burn nox catalysts, selective catalytic reduction (scr), and lean nox traps (lnts).
lean-burn nox catalysts promote the reduction of nox under oxygen-rich conditions. reduction of nox in an oxidizing atmosphere is difficult. it has proven challenging to find a lean-burn nox catalyst that has the required activity, durability, and operating temperature range. lean-burn nox catalysts also tend to be hydrothermally unstable. a noticeable loss of activity occurs after relatively little use. lean-burn nox catalysts typically employ a zeolite wash coat, which is thought to provide a reducing microenvironment. the introduction of a reductant, such as diesel fuel, into the exhaust is generally required and introduces a fuel economy penalty of 3% or more. currently, peak nox conversion efficiencies for lean-burn catalysts are unacceptably low.
scr generally refers to selective catalytic reduction of nox by ammonia. the reaction takes place even in an oxidizing environment. the nox can be temporarily stored in an absorbent or ammonia can be fed continuously into the exhaust. scr can achieve high levels of nox reduction, but there is a disadvantage in the lack of infrastructure for distributing ammonia or a suitable precursor. another concern relates to the possible release of ammonia into the environment.
lnts are devices with nox absorbents and catalysts that reduce nox during regeneration. the absorbent is typically an alkaline earth oxide absorbent, such as baco3 and the catalyst is typically a precious metal, such as pt or ru. in lean exhaust, the catalyst speeds oxidizing reactions that lead to nox adsorption. accumulated nox is removed and the lnt is regenerated by creating a reducing environment within the lnt. in a reducing environment, the catalyst activates reactions by which adsorbed nox is reduced and desorbed.
a lnt can produce ammonia during denitration. accordingly, it has been proposed to combine a lnt and an ammonia scr catalyst into one system. ammonia produced by the lnt during regeneration is captured by the scr catalyst for subsequent use in reducing nox, thereby improving conversion efficiency over a stand-alone lnt with no increase in fuel penalty or precious metal usage. u.s. pat. no. 6,732,507 describes such a system. u.s. pat. pub. no. 2004/0076565describes such systems wherein both components are contained within a single shell or disbursed over one substrate. wo 2004/090296 describes such a system wherein there is an inline reformer upstream of the lnt and the scr catalyst.
creating a reducing environment for lnt regeneration involves eliminating most of the oxygen from the exhaust and providing a reducing agent. except where the engine can be run stoichiometric or rich, a portion of the reductant reacts within the exhaust to consume oxygen. the amount of oxygen to be removed by reaction with reductant can be reduced in various ways. if the engine is equipped with an intake air throttle, the throttle can be used. the transmission gear ratio can be changed to shift the engine to an operating point that produces equal power but contains less oxygen. however, at least in the case of a diesel engine, it is generally necessary to eliminate some of the oxygen in the exhaust by combustion or reforming reactions with reductant that is injected into the exhaust.
reductant can be injected into the exhaust by the engine or a separate fuel injection device. for example, the engine can inject extra fuel into the exhaust within one or more cylinders prior to expelling the exhaust. alternatively, or in addition, reductant can be injected into the exhaust downstream of the engine.
the reactions between reductant and oxygen can take place in the lnt, although it is generally preferred for the reactions to occur in a catalyst upstream of the lnt, whereby the heat of reaction does not cause large temperature increase within the lnt at every regeneration.
in addition to accumulating nox, lnts accumulate sox. sox is the combustion product of sulfur present in ordinarily fuel. even with reduced sulfur fuels, the amount of sox produced by combustion is significant. sox adsorbs more strongly than nox and necessitates a more stringent, though less frequent, regeneration. desulfation requires elevated temperatures as well as a reducing atmosphere. the temperature of the exhaust can be elevated by engine measures, particularly in the case of a lean-burn gasoline engine, however, at least in the case of a diesel engine, it is often necessary to provide additional heat. typically, this heat is provided through the same types of reactions as used to remove excess oxygen from the exhaust.
u.s. pat. no. 6,832,473 describes a system wherein the reductant is reformate produced outside the exhaust stream and injected into the exhaust as needed. during desulfations, the reformate is injected upstream of an oxidation catalyst. heat generated by combustion of the reformate over the oxidation catalyst is carried by the exhaust to the lnt and raises the lnt to desulfations temperatures.
u.s. pat. pub. no. 2003/0101713 describes an exhaust treatment system with a fuel reformer placed in the exhaust line upstream of a lnt. the reformer includes both oxidation and reforming catalysts. the reformer both removes excess oxygen and converts the diesel fuel reductant into more reactive reformate. for desulfations, heat produced by the reformer is used to raise the lnt to desulfations temperatures. the diesel fuel injection may be pulsed to control the reformer temperature.
in spite of advances, there continues to be a long felt need for an affordable and reliable exhaust treatment system that is durable, has a manageable operating cost (including fuel penalty), and is practical for reducing nox emissions from diesel engines to a satisfactory extent in the sense of meeting u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) regulations effective in 2010 and other such regulations.
several of the inventors' concepts relates to methods of desulfating a lnt. the methods generally apply to a system in which a first device, which may be a fuel reformer, is placed upstream of the lnt in an exhaust treatment system. reductant is injected upstream of the first device. much of the reductant is oxidized and/or reformed in the first device and generates heat there.

a further concept relates to a control strategy for desulfation that involves reductant injection that is intermittent on two time scales, one shorter and one longer. the intermittency on the longer time scale is generally used to control the temperature of an lnt. the intermittency on the shorter time scale is generally used to control the temperature of an upstream device, the first device referred to above, which is typically a fuel reformer.
a still further concept also relates to a desulfation control strategy for an exhaust treatment system having a first device upstream of a lnt and a reductant supply upstream of the first device. according to this strategy, the reductant supply is pulsed to control the temperature of the lnt. the pulse periods and durations are selected whereby reductant is provided to the lnt while the lnt temperature is still near a peak resulting from combustion of reductant injected during the previous pulse. a portion of the reductant, pyrolyzed, or reformed products thereof, maybe stored in the lnt during periods or reductant injection and may combust during periods of no reductant injection when the oxygen concentration within the lnt increases. if the lnt temperature varies over each pulse period between a minimum and a maximum differing by at least about 50Â° c., the lnt temperature will generally be within about 25Â° c. of the maximum at the onset of reductant injection.

US07669408,lnt desulfation strategy with reformer temperature management,"desulfation methods for an exhaust treatment system having a fuel reformer configured upstream of a lnt. reductant is injected upstream of the fuel reformer. the reductant reacts within the reformer to generate heat, but the system is configured for some reductant to breakthrough and react in the lnt to generate further heat. this configuration allows the lnt to operate at temperatures higher the than first device and facilitates independent control of the lnt and first device temperatures. an outer loop controls the lnt temperature by issuing instructions to an inner loop that controls the reformer. typically, the inner loop will pulse the reductant injection rate in order to limit the reformer temperature. the outer loop can pulses the loop on a longer time scale, resulting in two pulse periods. through timing, a reformate peak from one period is made to overlap a temperature peak from a previous period.","the present invention relates to pollution control systems and methods for diesel and lean burn gasoline engines.
nox emissions from diesel engines are an environmental problem. several countries, including the united states, have long had regulations pending that will limit nox emissions from trucks and other diesel-powered vehicles. manufacturers and researchers have put considerable effort toward meeting those regulations.
in gasoline powered vehicles that use stoichiometric fuel-air mixtures, three-way catalysts have been shown to control nox emissions. in diesel-powered vehicles, which use compression ignition, the exhaust is generally too oxygen-rich for three-way catalysts to be effective.
several solutions have been proposed for controlling nox emissions from diesel-powered vehicles. one set of approaches focuses on the engine. techniques such as exhaust gas recirculation and partially homogenizing fuel-air mixtures are helpful, but these techniques alone will not eliminate nox emissions. another set of approaches remove nox from the vehicle exhaust. these include the use of lean-burn nox catalysts, selective catalytic reduction (scr), and lean nox traps (lnts).
lean-burn nox catalysts promote the reduction of nox under oxygen-rich conditions. reduction of nox in an oxidizing atmosphere is difficult. it has proven challenging to find a lean-burn nox catalyst that has the required activity, durability, and operating temperature range. lean-burn nox catalysts also tend to be hydrothermally unstable. a noticeable loss of activity occurs after relatively little use. lean-burn nox catalysts typically employ a zeolite wash coat, which is thought to provide a reducing microenvironment. the introduction of a reductant, such as diesel fuel, into the exhaust is generally required and introduces a fuel economy penalty of 3% or more. currently, peak nox conversion efficiencies for lean-burn catalysts are unacceptably low.
scr generally refers to selective catalytic reduction of nox by ammonia. the reaction takes place even in an oxidizing environment. the nox can be temporarily stored in an absorbent or ammonia can be fed continuously into the exhaust. scr can achieve high levels of nox reduction, but there is a disadvantage in the lack of infrastructure for distributing ammonia or a suitable precursor. another concern relates to the possible release of ammonia into the environment.
lnts are devices with nox absorbents and catalysts that reduce nox during regeneration. the absorbent is typically an alkaline earth oxide absorbent, such as baco3 and the catalyst is typically a precious metal, such as pt or ru. in lean exhaust, the catalyst speeds oxidizing reactions that lead to nox adsorption. accumulated nox is removed and the lnt is regenerated by creating a reducing environment within the lnt. in a reducing environment, the catalyst activates reactions by which adsorbed nox is reduced and desorbed.
a lnt can produce ammonia during denitration. accordingly, it has been proposed to combine a lnt and an ammonia scr catalyst into one system. ammonia produced by the lnt during regeneration is captured by the scr catalyst for subsequent use in reducing nox, thereby improving conversion efficiency over a stand-alone lnt with no increase in fuel penalty or precious metal usage. u.s. pat. no. 6,732,507 describes such a system. u.s. pat. pub. no. 2004/0076565describes such systems wherein both components are contained within a single shell or disbursed over one substrate. wo 2004/090296 describes such a system wherein there is an inline reformer upstream of the lnt and the scr catalyst.
creating a reducing environment for lnt regeneration involves eliminating most of the oxygen from the exhaust and providing a reducing agent. except where the engine can be run stoichiometric or rich, a portion of the reductant reacts within the exhaust to consume oxygen. the amount of oxygen to be removed by reaction with reductant can be reduced in various ways. if the engine is equipped with an intake air throttle, the throttle can be used. the transmission gear ratio can be changed to shift the engine to an operating point that produces equal power but contains less oxygen. however, at least in the case of a diesel engine, it is generally necessary to eliminate some of the oxygen in the exhaust by combustion or reforming reactions with reductant that is injected into the exhaust.
reductant can be injected into the exhaust by the engine or a separate fuel injection device. for example, the engine can inject extra fuel into the exhaust within one or more cylinders prior to expelling the exhaust. alternatively, or in addition, reductant can be injected into the exhaust downstream of the engine.
the reactions between reductant and oxygen can take place in the lnt, although it is generally preferred for the reactions to occur in a catalyst upstream of the lnt, whereby the heat of reaction does not cause large temperature increase within the lnt at every regeneration.
in addition to accumulating nox, lnts accumulate sox. sox is the combustion product of sulfur present in ordinarily fuel. even with reduced sulfur fuels, the amount of sox produced by combustion is significant. sox adsorbs more strongly than nox and necessitates a more stringent, though less frequent, regeneration. desulfation requires elevated temperatures as well as a reducing atmosphere. the temperature of the exhaust can be elevated by engine measures, particularly in the case of a lean-burn gasoline engine, however, at least in the case of a diesel engine, it is often necessary to provide additional heat. typically, this heat is provided through the same types of reactions as used to remove excess oxygen from the exhaust.
u.s. pat. no. 6,832,473 describes a system wherein the reductant is reformate produced outside the exhaust stream and injected into the exhaust as needed. during desulfations, the reformate is injected upstream of an oxidation catalyst. heat generated by combustion of the reformate over the oxidation catalyst is carried by the exhaust to the lnt and raises the lnt to desulfations temperatures.
u.s. pat. pub. no. 2003/0101713 describes an exhaust treatment system with a fuel reformer placed in the exhaust line upstream of a lnt. the reformer includes both oxidation and reforming catalysts. the reformer both removes excess oxygen and converts the diesel fuel reductant into more reactive reformate. for desulfations, heat produced by the reformer is used to raise the lnt to desulfations temperatures. the diesel fuel injection may be pulsed to control the reformer temperature.
in spite of advances, there continues to be a long felt need for an affordable and reliable exhaust treatment system that is durable, has a manageable operating cost (including fuel penalty), and is practical for reducing nox emissions from diesel engines to a satisfactory extent in the sense of meeting u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) regulations effective in 2010 and other such regulations.
several of the inventors' concepts relates to methods of desulfating a lnt. the methods generally apply to a system in which a first device, which may be a fuel reformer, is placed upstream of the lnt in an exhaust treatment system. reductant is injected upstream of the first device. much of the reductant is oxidized and/or reformed in the first device and generates heat there.
according to one of the inventors' concepts for desulfating a lnt, a significant additional portion of the reductant and/or reformed products thereof react within the lnt to generate further heat. typically, the lnt temperature is thereby raised to a peak that is at least about 100Â° c. higher than the temperature of the exhaust entering the lnt. this concept allows the lnt to operate at higher temperatures than the first device and facilitates independent control of the lnt and first device temperatures in conjunction with methods described below.
another concept relates to a control strategy that applies to the above-described system. an outer loop controls the lnt temperature by issuing instructions to an inner loop that controls the first device. the instructions involve, for example, switching modes for the inner loop (e.g., between on and off modes). the inner loop controls the first device temperature through control at least over the reductant injection rate. typically, the inner loop will pulse the reductant injection rate in order to limit the first device temperature. the outer loop can pulse the operation of the inner loop to independently control the temperature of the lnt.
a similar concept also relates to a method of desulfating a lnt in an exhaust aftertreatment system comprising a first device upstream of the lnt. the method comprises controlling a temperature of the lnt to within a first range by varying a supply of diesel fuel to the exhaust upstream of the first device. the control strategy comprising two modes of diesel fuel supply, a first mode of which comprises supplying diesel fuel in a manner that regulates the temperature of the first catalyst to within a second range having a minimum and a maximum, and a second mode in which the diesel fuel supply is substantially terminated, whereby the temperature of the first device falls below the minimum of the second range.

internal combustion engines, including diesel engines, gasoline engines, gaseous fuel-powered engines, and other engines known in the art, exhaust a complex mixture of air pollutants. these air pollutants may include solid material known as particulate matter or soot. due to increased awareness of the environment, exhaust emission standards have become more stringent and the amount of particulate matter emitted from an engine may be regulated depending on the type of engine, size of engine, and/or class of engine.
one method implemented by engine manufacturers for complying with the regulation of particulate matter exhausted to the environment has been to remove the particulate matter from the exhaust flow of an engine using a device called a particulate trap. a particulate trap is a filter, typically consisting of a wire mesh or ceramic honeycomb medium, which is designed to trap particulate matter. unfortunately, the use of the particulate trap for extended periods of time may cause the particulate matter to build up in the medium, thereby reducing the functionality of the filter and subsequent performance of the engine.
built-up particulate matter may be removed from the filter through a process called regeneration. to initiate regeneration of the filter, the temperature of the particulate matter captured within the filter must be elevated to a combustion threshold, at which the particulate matter may slowly burn away. often, the temperature of the exhaust flow as emitted by the engine raises the particulate temperature to that sufficient for regeneration. during some situations however, such as low engine load or during the winter months, the temperature of the exhaust may be insufficient to raise the particulate matter to the required combustion threshold.
one way to remedy this problem is to artificially reduce the combustion threshold of the collected particulate matter to a temperature below that of the exhaust such that regeneration can be achieved. an example of a system that implements this method is described in u.s. pat. no. 6,397,584 (the '584 patent) issued to salvat et al. on jun. 4, 2002. specifically, the '584 patent discloses a system for assisting the regeneration of a particle filter integrated into an exhaust line of a motor vehicle diesel engine. this system includes a supply of additive, which is continuously injected into a fuel tank of the engine. the additive mixes with the fuel, and the mixture is combusted to produce a flow of exhaust containing soot particles bonded with a metal compound. the compound-bonded particle has a lower ignition temperature than non-bonded particles. when the lowered ignition temperature is attained with the engine's exhaust flow, the soot particles and metal compounds are burned, leaving behind ash, which may be effectively removed from the filter during periodic maintenance of the engine.
although the system of the '584 patent may suitably regenerate a particulate filter, it may be costly and problematic. in particular, the low-temperature situations requiring the injection of the additive may be intermittent and, because the system of the '584 patent always injects that additive, some additive may be wasted. this wasted additive drives up the cost of the system. in addition, because the additive is converted to ash during the regeneration process, excessive amounts of additive may result in excessive amounts of ash. because the maintenance interval of the engine may be at least partially based on the accumulation rate of ash within the particle filter, the excessive amounts of ash may significantly reduce the maintenance interval. a reduced maintenance interval, in addition to creating an inconvenience for the vehicle owner, also serves to increase the operating cost of the vehicle.

one way to remedy this problem is to artificially reduce the combustion threshold of the collected particulate matter to a temperature below that of the exhaust such that regeneration can be achieved. an example of a system that implements this method is described in u.s. pat. no. 6,397,584 (the '584 patent) issued to salvat et al. on jun. 4, 2002. specifically, the '584 patent discloses a system for assisting the regeneration of a particle filter integrated into an exhaust line of a motor vehicle diesel engine. this system includes a supply of additive, which is continuously injected into a fuel tank of the engine. the additive mixes with the fuel, and the mixture is combusted to produce a flow of exhaust containing soot particles bonded with a metal compound. the compound-bonded particle has a lower ignition temperature than non-bonded particles. when the lowered ignition temperature is attained with the engine's exhaust flow, the soot particles and metal compounds are burned, leaving behind ash, which may be effectively removed from the filter during periodic maintenance of the engine.
although the system of the '584 patent may suitably regenerate a particulate filter, it may be costly and problematic. in particular, the low-temperature situations requiring the injection of the additive may be intermittent and, because the system of the '584 patent always injects that additive, some additive may be wasted. this wasted additive drives up the cost of the system. in addition, because the additive is converted to ash during the regeneration process, excessive amounts of additive may result in excessive amounts of ash. because the maintenance interval of the engine may be at least partially based on the accumulation rate of ash within the particle filter, the excessive amounts of ash may significantly reduce the maintenance interval. a reduced maintenance interval, in addition to creating an inconvenience for the vehicle owner, also serves to increase the operating cost of the vehicle.

US07669410,sulfur purge control method for exhaust gas purifying system and exhaust gas purifying system,"in an exhaust gas purifying system which is equipped with an nox occlusion reduction type catalyst (?œnox catalyst?? and an oxidation catalyst set on the upstream side of the nox catalyst, and in which sulfur purge control for regenerating the sulfur-poisoned catalyst is conducted, an air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge is conducted when a temperature difference between an inlet side and an outlet side of the nox catalyst is outside a given range. sulfur poison on the nox catalyst can be uniformly removed in sulfur-purge regeneration control, thereby extending the service life of the nox catalyst. further, the nox catalyst can be protected from thermal deterioration caused by partial temperature rise inside the nox catalyst on its downstream side, so that the service life of the nox catalyst can also be extended.","the present invention relates to an exhaust gas purification system provided with a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for reducing and purifying nox (nitrogen oxides) in exhaust gas of an interval combustion engine, and to a sulfur purge control method of the same.
nox catalysts for reducing and removing nox from exhaust gas of various combustion devices such as internal combustion engines of diesel engines, some gasoline engines, are researched and proposed. one of them is a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst as a nox lowering catalyst for diesel engines. this catalyst can effectively purify nox in exhaust gas by use of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst.
for example, the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst has the following catalyst reaction function as shown in japanese patent application kokai publication no. 1998-30430. the catalyst makes a nox metal such as barium (ba) having the property of occluding nox, occlude no2 after oxidizing no (nitric oxide) into no2 (nitrogen dioxide) in the case of an air-fuel ratio in a lean-state. then, a nox regeneration control for realizing a rich-state of an air-fuel ratio is executed, thereby the no2 is inversely released from the occlusion material and the no2 is purified through ternary function by using a hc (hydrocarbon), co (carbon monoxide).
this nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is a catalyst of a type mainly carrying precious metals for facilitating an oxidation-reduction reaction and nox occlusion material (nox occlusion substance) having the function of occluding and releasing nox on a catalyst carrier such as alumina. the precious metal is platinum (pt) or palladium (pd), etc. the nox occlusion material is alkali earth metal such as barium (ba).
in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in is lean and oxygen (o2) exists in the atmosphere, the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst oxidizes nitric oxide (no) in the exhaust gas by precious metals into nitrogen dioxide (no2), and the oxidized no2 is accumulated in the nox occlusion material as a nitrate salt (ba2no4 etc.).
moreover, in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in is a stoichiometric air fuel ratio or in a rich state (low oxide concentration) and oxygen is not present in the atmosphere, the nox occlusion material such as barium (ba) is connected to carbon monoxide (co) and nitrogen dioxide (no2) is resolved and released from the nitrate salt. this released nitrogen dioxide (no2) is reduced by unburned hydrocarbon (hc) or carbon monoxide (co) etc contained in the exhaust gas through a three-way function of the precious metal group and becomes a nitride (n2). thereby, the various components contained in the exhaust gas are released into the atmosphere as harmless substances such as carbon dioxide (co2), water (h2o), nitride (n2).
therefore, the exhaust gas purification system with the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst executes a nox regenerating operation which performs a rich control of the air fuel ratio for regenerating the nox occlusion ability when its nox occlusion ability approaches saturation. thus, the absorbed nox is released and the released nox is reduced through a precious metal catalyst.
however, there is the problem that its performance is deteriorated by sulfur poisoning of this nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. that is, sulfur contained in fuel becomes sulfur dioxide (so2) through burning, is occluded in the occlusion material in the same manner as nitrogen dioxide (no2), and generates a sulfate such as barium sulfate (ba2so4). thereby, the occlusion ability of nitrogen dioxide (no2) decreases.
therefore, in order to maintain the initial catalyst purifying performance, adding to recover the nox occlusion ability by nox regeneration control, it is necessary to separate sulfur absorbed and occluded in catalyst and to cause it to be released. this separation and release of sulfur requires a higher temperature than a certain temperature and a reduction atmosphere in the exhaust gas content. thus, an environment that facilitates the resolution of the sulfate is required by performing sulfur purge control for an atmosphere of a rich state of an air fuel ratio.
for example, as disclosed in japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2003-500594, japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2003-336518, japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2004-92445, sulfate is not resolved and is not released, if a rich condition at a high temperature of about 600Â° c. to 700Â° c. is not attained. moreover, for oxide concentration, since a reducing agent such as a hydrocarbon (hc) or carbon monoxide (co) uses an oxide (o2) for oxidization, resolution of the sulfate (ba2 so4 etc.) is not facilitated and sulfur purge is not caused.
in conventional technology, a method for raising the exhaust gas temperature to a sulfur resolution temperature (sulfur purgeable temperature) includes a post injection method with fuel injection inside a cylinder and a direct fuel addition method in an exhaust pipe. further, on the engine side, heat capacity of the exhaust gas is lowered through decreasing the flow-volume of the exhaust gas by an intake throttle etc.
however, in this sulfur purge control, there is the problem of evenness of temperature in the catalyst and the problem of generation of hydrogen sulfide.
the problem of evenness of temperature in the catalyst will be described referring to fig. 13 and fig. 14. fig. 13 shows a temperature distribution in a catalyst, and fig. 14 shows a time series of catalyst temperatures. in fig. 14, s shows the amount of sulfur purge, and Î» shows the air excess rate. also, tf, tm, and ta show catalyst temperatures on the upstream side, midstream side and downstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst respectively.
the conventional technological method for raising the temperature cannot make the temperature distribution inside a catalyst uniform in a rich process of taking a reduction atmosphere of exhaust gas content after raising the temperature of the catalyst as shown in fig. 13 and fig. 14. that is, the temperature of the upstream area f in the catalyst cannot be raised higher than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd, and the temperature tf enters a low temperature area less than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd. on the other hand, the midstream area m and the downstream area a in the catalyst only become higher than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd.
therefore, even if the sulfur purge operation is performed, since sulfur in the upstream area f in the catalyst having the temperature lower than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd is insufficient for its separation and release, catalyst performance is not recovered. besides, since catalyst activation is low, oxidation consumption of the catalyst surface and the inside of an occlusion agent becomes insufficient and the reduction atmosphere on the catalyst surface is insufficient. thus, the sulfur separation effect is extremely lowered and recovery of catalyst performance becomes impossible.
furthermore, the temperature of the midstream area m of the catalyst is higher than the sulfur separation resolution temperature tsd and lower than the catalyst thermal deterioration temperature tcd. since sulfur separation is effectively performed under a rich state of an air fuel ratio, the catalyst is recovered from sulfur poisoning.
however, in the downstream area a of the catalyst, its temperature ta also rises and becomes an abnormally extreme temperature above the catalyst thermal deterioration temperature tcd. thereby, the catalyst causes extreme thermal deterioration and its durability is extremely lowered.
on the other hand, if the catalyst temperature tc is raised up to the sulfur resolution temperature tsd in the upstream area f in the catalyst, the abnormally high temperature area where the temperature in the catalyst is higher than the catalyst thermal deterioration tcd extends due to the evenness of temperature distribution in the catalyst. as a result, the problem of extreme thermal deterioration and the problem of the enlargement of the area in which the durability of catalyst is extremely lowered, occur.
next, the problem of generation of hydrogen sulfide will be described below referring to fig. 9. fig. 9 is a view illustrating a time series of a sulfur purge control and shows a continuous rich control according to conventional technology on its left side.
if an oxide (o2) is not present upon sulfur purge control, sulfur connects with hydrogen (h2) and generates and emits the harmful gas of hydrogen sulfide (h2s). therefore, it is necessary to re-oxidize hydrogen sulfide (h2s) and to release sulfur as sulfur dioxide (so2). also, since heat generation depending on the oxidation reaction is small, the catalyst temperature lowers during sulfur purge. thus, the atmospheric condition that includes a small amount of oxygen (o2) necessary to oxidize hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is required.
if the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the catalyst is maintained in a rich state in which air fuel ratio is larger than theoretical air fuel ratio, the released sulfur dioxide (so2) and hydrocarbon (hc) of the reducing agent react due to insufficient oxygen and the generation rate of the noxious smelling hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is higher.
on the other hand, in the case where the oxygen concentration on the catalyst outlet side is maintained in a stoichiometric state, hydrogen sulfide (h2s) can be lowered as shown at the right end a of fig. 9. however, the amount of sulfur purge is equal to ??or less. thereby, sulfur purge control time for purging sulfur becomes longer. in this sulfur purge, the catalyst temperature is set to a high temperature of about 700Â° c. if sulfur purge control time becomes longer, problems such as high costs and catalyst deterioration are caused.
furthermore, regarding sulfur purge control for sulfur poisoning regeneration (recovery) of a nox catalyst, for example, in japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2000-170525, a exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine is proposed as follows. for effective improvement of sox release from an sox absorption agent (nox absorption agent), the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in the sox absorption agent is controlled so that the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas at the outlet of the sox absorption agent is in a stoichiometric air fuel ratio (stoichiometric). in this air fuel ratio control, at first the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in sox absorption agent is controlled in a rich state and then the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in is controlled to approach the stoichiometric air fuel ratio.
however, in this exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine in the case where the excess air rate Î» of the catalyst inlet side is maintained in a rich state not more than 1.0 so that the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas at the outlet of the sox absorption agent becomes a stoichiometric air fuel ratio (stoichiometric), oxygen is not sufficient. therefore, the released sulfur dioxide (so2) and hydrocarbon (hc) of the reducing agent react with each other, and hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is generated.
moreover, for example, japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2003-336518 (page 5) proposes the following exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine. in order to check the excess rich value of the air fuel ratio upon sulfur purge control, an electric control unit (ecu) executes fuel addition control (so called rich spike control) so that oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas flowing into a filter is lowered in a spike manner in a relatively short period in recovering the sox-poison.
however, this exhaust gas purifying device does not show a response of changing to hydrogen sulfide (h2s) from sulfur dioxide (so2) because of insufficient oxygen. also, for application, specific values of a rich and lean air fuel ratio, rich duration period, and lean duration period are required, but these specific combinations are not described.
the present invention is developed to resolve the above problems. in a exhaust gas purification system using a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for purifying nox in exhaust gas, it is the objective of the present invention to uniformly remove sulfur poisoning of a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst by uniformly maintaining a temperature of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst to that not less than the sulfur resolution temperature and performing air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge during sulfur purge regeneration control for sulfur poisoning regeneration. thereby, the durational period of the deterioration of a catalyst caused by sulfur poisoning is avoided and also its thermal deterioration is prevented in the downstream area in the catalyst from being at a high temperature. accordingly, it is its objective to provide an exhaust gas purification system and a sulfur purge control method of the same.
furthermore, in the exhaust gas purification system using the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for purifying nox in exhaust gas, it is a further objective to provide an exhaust gas purification system and a sulfur purge control method of the same capable of maintaining a catalyst temperature during sulfur purging and also capable of increasing the rate of sulfur dioxide (so2) by restricting the generation amount of hydrogen sulfide (h2s) during sulfur purge regeneration control.
a sulfur purge control method of an exhaust gas purification system for attaining the above objectives is provided with a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for occluding nox in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is lean, and releasing the occluded nox to reduce it in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is rich, and an oxidation catalyst in the upstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. the method is for executing a sulfur purge control for deterioration recovery caused by sulfur poisoning of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and the sulfur purge control is executed after the temperature difference between the inlet side and the outlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is in a temperature value not more than a given temperature value by raising the exhaust temperature.
moreover, the air fuel ratio state of the exhaust gas described in the above does not always mean an air fuel ratio state in a cylinder, but means a ratio of air amount to fuel amount supplied in the exhaust gas flowing in the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst (including the burned amount in the cylinder).
also, the oxidation catalyst may be placed on the upstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and may be a 2 brick type catalyst carrying the oxidation catalyst on the upstream area of the catalyst honeycomb and the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst on the downstream area of the catalyst honeycomb.
by this structure that the oxidation catalyst is disposed on the pre-stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, hydrocarbon (hc) reacts to the oxidized catalyst of the upstream area and the temperature of exhaust gas is raised. therefore, the exhaust gas has higher temperature than its activation temperature from steps before flowing in the post stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. for this reason, the post stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is uniformed in the catalyst temperature distribution, the catalyst is uniformly raised in temperature to sulfur resolution temperature in whole.
furthermore, before entering the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge, the system is controlled so as to enter the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge after it is confirmed that the temperature difference of the inlet area and the outlet area of the catalyst is within a given temperature difference, that is, after it is confirmed that the temperature distribution in the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is uniform. thereby, sulfur is separated from the catalyst certainly.
in the above sulfur purge control method of the exhaust gas purification system, the given temperature value is set to a range of 5Â° c. to 25Â° c., preferably 5Â° c. by this, equalization of the catalyst temperature distribution of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst can be realized with accuracy, and the sulfur purge is effectively performed.
also, the control whereby the air fuel ratio on the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is set to rich and the control whereby it is set to lean are alternately repeated when executing the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge.
furthermore, in the above sulfur purge control method of the exhaust gas purification system, the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of a target air fuel ratio of the inlet side is set to 0.85 to 0.95 for an air excess rate conversion on the rich side control and to 1.05 to 1.15 for an air excess rate conversion on the lean side control is performed.
in the sulfur purge control for sulfur poisoning recovery of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst (regeneration, sulfur purge), this air fuel ratio control method of the catalyst inlet side periodically repeats a rich state of the air fuel ratio of 0.85 to 0.95, preferably 0.9 for an air excess rate conversion on the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and a lean state of the air fuel ratio of 1.05 to 1.15, preferably 1.1. by this control, the reducing agent for raising the temperature of the exhaust gas can be sufficiently saved and at the same time the oxygen amount for oxidizing hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2) can be provided in the needed amount. moreover, these specific values have been obtained from experiments.
that is, at first the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is temporally set to a lean state of 1.05 to 1.15. by this, raising the temperature of the exhaust gas and the oxygen atmosphere is adequately made and it becomes possible to supply just the appropriate amount of oxygen for converting hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2) by oxidation. thus, hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is oxidized into sulfur dioxide (so2). therefore, it becomes possible to facilitate sulfur purging by sulfur dioxide (so2) and maintain the temperature during sulfur purge control by heat generated through oxidation. thereby, since the rate of sulfur dioxide (so2) is increased through restricting the generated amount of hydrogen sulfide (h2s) and the generated amount of sulfur dioxide (so2) is saved, the sulfur purge is completed early. thus, the sulfur purge control is completed in a short time.
moreover, in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above sulfur purge control method in the exhaust gas purification system, the target air fuel ratio of the inlet side is controlled by feedback control so that the air fuel ratio of the outlet side of the above nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is in a stoichiometric state during the sulfur purge control.
that is, the value of the Î» sensor is always controlled to a value not more than the stoichiometric amount in the outlet side (downstream side) of the catalyst, and the air fuel ratio of the inlet side or a target value in an interval between rich and lean is controlled by feedback control so as to maintain a stoichiometric air fuel ratio as a target value when slightly rich. by this, since it is not more than the stoichiometric air fuel ratio at all times after the middle stage of the catalyst, the sulfur purge becomes possible.
furthermore, in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above sulfur purge control method in the exhaust gas purification system, the rate of the control period for rich side control and lean side control is set to 5:2 to 4:3 for rich side control and lean side control respectively. by these controls, the rate of the reducing agent amount appropriate for the sulfur purge and the oxygen amount is adequately made, and sulfur can be efficiently purged while restricting the generation of hydrogen sulfide (h2s). more, these specific values have been obtained from experiments.
an exhaust gas purification system for offering the above objective is provided with a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for occluding nox in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is lean, and releasing the occluded nox to reduce it in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is rich, an oxidation catalyst disposed in the upstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and a sulfur purge control means executing a sulfur purge control for recovering the deterioration caused by sulfur poisoning of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. the sulfur purge control means is constituted to execute the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge when executing the sulfur purge control after a temperature difference between the inlet side and the outlet side reaches a given temperature value or less, by raising exhaust gas temperature.
furthermore, in the above exhaust gas purification system, the given temperature value is set to a temperature range of 5Â° c. to 25Â° c., preferably 5Â° c. also, the sulfur purge control means constituted to alternately repeat a rich side control whereby the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is rich, and a lean side control where it is lean.
furthermore, in the above exhaust gas purification system, the sulfur purge control method is constituted to set the target air fuel ratio of the inlet side to 0.85 to 0.95 for an air excess rate conversion in the rich side control, and to 1.05 to 1.15 for an air excess rate conversion in the lean side control.
in the above exhaust gas purification system, sulfur purge control means feedback controls the target air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the above nox occlusion reduction type catalyst in such a way that the air fuel ratio of the outlet side thereof is in a stoichiometric state during sulfur purge control.
in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above exhaust gas purification system, the rate of control time of a rich control and a lean control is set to 5:2 to 4:3 for a rich side control time and a lean side control time respectively.
as mentioned in the above, in the exhaust gas purification system and the sulfur purge control method using the same according to the present invention, the sulfur poisoning of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is uniformly removed by executing the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge after uniformly raising the temperature of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst not lower than the sulfur resolution temperature. by this, the durational period deterioration caused by sulfur poisoning can be avoided and the back side of the catalyst can be prevented from a partial temperature rise during sulfur purge control. therefore, thermal deterioration caused by partial high temperatures can be prevented, so the durational deterioration can be suppressed by thermal deterioration.
furthermore, since the air fuel ratio at the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is periodically repeated between a rich state of 0.85 to 0.95 and a lean state of 1.05 to 1.15 for an excess air rate conversion and is feedback controlled to be in a stoichiometric state on the downstream of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, a reducing agent necessary for raising the exhaust gas temperature can be certainly saved, and at the same time it is possible to provide an oxygen amount necessary for oxidizing hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2).
that is, oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2) can be certainly attained by not maintaining the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst in rich state, and intermittently repeating a lean state. and at the same time, sulfur purge can be facilitated and a high temperature for sulfur purge can be maintained.
by this, an oxygen atmosphere and exhaust gas temperature are made to be appropriate, the rate of sulfur dioxide (so2) is higher restraining the generated amount of oxidizing hydrogen sulfide (h2s), and the generated sulfur purge amount can be saved. therefore, since sulfur purge can be completed early, sulfur purge control can be finished in a short time.",1,problem,sulfur poisoning of nox occlusion reduction type catalyst,1.0,partial,-1

nox catalysts for reducing and removing nox from exhaust gas of various combustion devices such as internal combustion engines of diesel engines, some gasoline engines, are researched and proposed. one of them is a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst as a nox lowering catalyst for diesel engines. this catalyst can effectively purify nox in exhaust gas by use of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst.
for example, the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst has the following catalyst reaction function as shown in japanese patent application kokai publication no. 1998-30430. the catalyst makes a nox metal such as barium (ba) having the property of occluding nox, occlude no2 after oxidizing no (nitric oxide) into no2 (nitrogen dioxide) in the case of an air-fuel ratio in a lean-state. then, a nox regeneration control for realizing a rich-state of an air-fuel ratio is executed, thereby the no2 is inversely released from the occlusion material and the no2 is purified through ternary function by using a hc (hydrocarbon), co (carbon monoxide).
this nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is a catalyst of a type mainly carrying precious metals for facilitating an oxidation-reduction reaction and nox occlusion material (nox occlusion substance) having the function of occluding and releasing nox on a catalyst carrier such as alumina. the precious metal is platinum (pt) or palladium (pd), etc. the nox occlusion material is alkali earth metal such as barium (ba).
in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in is lean and oxygen (o2) exists in the atmosphere, the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst oxidizes nitric oxide (no) in the exhaust gas by precious metals into nitrogen dioxide (no2), and the oxidized no2 is accumulated in the nox occlusion material as a nitrate salt (ba2no4 etc.).
moreover, in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in is a stoichiometric air fuel ratio or in a rich state (low oxide concentration) and oxygen is not present in the atmosphere, the nox occlusion material such as barium (ba) is connected to carbon monoxide (co) and nitrogen dioxide (no2) is resolved and released from the nitrate salt. this released nitrogen dioxide (no2) is reduced by unburned hydrocarbon (hc) or carbon monoxide (co) etc contained in the exhaust gas through a three-way function of the precious metal group and becomes a nitride (n2). thereby, the various components contained in the exhaust gas are released into the atmosphere as harmless substances such as carbon dioxide (co2), water (h2o), nitride (n2).
therefore, the exhaust gas purification system with the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst executes a nox regenerating operation which performs a rich control of the air fuel ratio for regenerating the nox occlusion ability when its nox occlusion ability approaches saturation. thus, the absorbed nox is released and the released nox is reduced through a precious metal catalyst.
however, there is the problem that its performance is deteriorated by sulfur poisoning of this nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. that is, sulfur contained in fuel becomes sulfur dioxide (so2) through burning, is occluded in the occlusion material in the same manner as nitrogen dioxide (no2), and generates a sulfate such as barium sulfate (ba2so4). thereby, the occlusion ability of nitrogen dioxide (no2) decreases.
therefore, in order to maintain the initial catalyst purifying performance, adding to recover the nox occlusion ability by nox regeneration control, it is necessary to separate sulfur absorbed and occluded in catalyst and to cause it to be released. this separation and release of sulfur requires a higher temperature than a certain temperature and a reduction atmosphere in the exhaust gas content. thus, an environment that facilitates the resolution of the sulfate is required by performing sulfur purge control for an atmosphere of a rich state of an air fuel ratio.
for example, as disclosed in japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2003-500594, japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2003-336518, japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2004-92445, sulfate is not resolved and is not released, if a rich condition at a high temperature of about 600Â° c. to 700Â° c. is not attained. moreover, for oxide concentration, since a reducing agent such as a hydrocarbon (hc) or carbon monoxide (co) uses an oxide (o2) for oxidization, resolution of the sulfate (ba2 so4 etc.) is not facilitated and sulfur purge is not caused.
in conventional technology, a method for raising the exhaust gas temperature to a sulfur resolution temperature (sulfur purgeable temperature) includes a post injection method with fuel injection inside a cylinder and a direct fuel addition method in an exhaust pipe. further, on the engine side, heat capacity of the exhaust gas is lowered through decreasing the flow-volume of the exhaust gas by an intake throttle etc.
however, in this sulfur purge control, there is the problem of evenness of temperature in the catalyst and the problem of generation of hydrogen sulfide.
the problem of evenness of temperature in the catalyst will be described referring to fig. 13 and fig. 14. fig. 13 shows a temperature distribution in a catalyst, and fig. 14 shows a time series of catalyst temperatures. in fig. 14, s shows the amount of sulfur purge, and Î» shows the air excess rate. also, tf, tm, and ta show catalyst temperatures on the upstream side, midstream side and downstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst respectively.
the conventional technological method for raising the temperature cannot make the temperature distribution inside a catalyst uniform in a rich process of taking a reduction atmosphere of exhaust gas content after raising the temperature of the catalyst as shown in fig. 13 and fig. 14. that is, the temperature of the upstream area f in the catalyst cannot be raised higher than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd, and the temperature tf enters a low temperature area less than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd. on the other hand, the midstream area m and the downstream area a in the catalyst only become higher than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd.
therefore, even if the sulfur purge operation is performed, since sulfur in the upstream area f in the catalyst having the temperature lower than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd is insufficient for its separation and release, catalyst performance is not recovered. besides, since catalyst activation is low, oxidation consumption of the catalyst surface and the inside of an occlusion agent becomes insufficient and the reduction atmosphere on the catalyst surface is insufficient. thus, the sulfur separation effect is extremely lowered and recovery of catalyst performance becomes impossible.
furthermore, the temperature of the midstream area m of the catalyst is higher than the sulfur separation resolution temperature tsd and lower than the catalyst thermal deterioration temperature tcd. since sulfur separation is effectively performed under a rich state of an air fuel ratio, the catalyst is recovered from sulfur poisoning.
however, in the downstream area a of the catalyst, its temperature ta also rises and becomes an abnormally extreme temperature above the catalyst thermal deterioration temperature tcd. thereby, the catalyst causes extreme thermal deterioration and its durability is extremely lowered.
on the other hand, if the catalyst temperature tc is raised up to the sulfur resolution temperature tsd in the upstream area f in the catalyst, the abnormally high temperature area where the temperature in the catalyst is higher than the catalyst thermal deterioration tcd extends due to the evenness of temperature distribution in the catalyst. as a result, the problem of extreme thermal deterioration and the problem of the enlargement of the area in which the durability of catalyst is extremely lowered, occur.
next, the problem of generation of hydrogen sulfide will be described below referring to fig. 9. fig. 9 is a view illustrating a time series of a sulfur purge control and shows a continuous rich control according to conventional technology on its left side.
if an oxide (o2) is not present upon sulfur purge control, sulfur connects with hydrogen (h2) and generates and emits the harmful gas of hydrogen sulfide (h2s). therefore, it is necessary to re-oxidize hydrogen sulfide (h2s) and to release sulfur as sulfur dioxide (so2). also, since heat generation depending on the oxidation reaction is small, the catalyst temperature lowers during sulfur purge. thus, the atmospheric condition that includes a small amount of oxygen (o2) necessary to oxidize hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is required.
if the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the catalyst is maintained in a rich state in which air fuel ratio is larger than theoretical air fuel ratio, the released sulfur dioxide (so2) and hydrocarbon (hc) of the reducing agent react due to insufficient oxygen and the generation rate of the noxious smelling hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is higher.
on the other hand, in the case where the oxygen concentration on the catalyst outlet side is maintained in a stoichiometric state, hydrogen sulfide (h2s) can be lowered as shown at the right end a of fig. 9. however, the amount of sulfur purge is equal to ??or less. thereby, sulfur purge control time for purging sulfur becomes longer. in this sulfur purge, the catalyst temperature is set to a high temperature of about 700Â° c. if sulfur purge control time becomes longer, problems such as high costs and catalyst deterioration are caused.
furthermore, regarding sulfur purge control for sulfur poisoning regeneration (recovery) of a nox catalyst, for example, in japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2000-170525, a exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine is proposed as follows. for effective improvement of sox release from an sox absorption agent (nox absorption agent), the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in the sox absorption agent is controlled so that the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas at the outlet of the sox absorption agent is in a stoichiometric air fuel ratio (stoichiometric). in this air fuel ratio control, at first the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in sox absorption agent is controlled in a rich state and then the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in is controlled to approach the stoichiometric air fuel ratio.
however, in this exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine in the case where the excess air rate Î» of the catalyst inlet side is maintained in a rich state not more than 1.0 so that the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas at the outlet of the sox absorption agent becomes a stoichiometric air fuel ratio (stoichiometric), oxygen is not sufficient. therefore, the released sulfur dioxide (so2) and hydrocarbon (hc) of the reducing agent react with each other, and hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is generated.
moreover, for example, japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2003-336518 (page 5) proposes the following exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine. in order to check the excess rich value of the air fuel ratio upon sulfur purge control, an electric control unit (ecu) executes fuel addition control (so called rich spike control) so that oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas flowing into a filter is lowered in a spike manner in a relatively short period in recovering the sox-poison.
however, this exhaust gas purifying device does not show a response of changing to hydrogen sulfide (h2s) from sulfur dioxide (so2) because of insufficient oxygen. also, for application, specific values of a rich and lean air fuel ratio, rich duration period, and lean duration period are required, but these specific combinations are not described.
the present invention is developed to resolve the above problems. in a exhaust gas purification system using a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for purifying nox in exhaust gas, it is the objective of the present invention to uniformly remove sulfur poisoning of a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst by uniformly maintaining a temperature of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst to that not less than the sulfur resolution temperature and performing air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge during sulfur purge regeneration control for sulfur poisoning regeneration. thereby, the durational period of the deterioration of a catalyst caused by sulfur poisoning is avoided and also its thermal deterioration is prevented in the downstream area in the catalyst from being at a high temperature. accordingly, it is its objective to provide an exhaust gas purification system and a sulfur purge control method of the same.
furthermore, in the exhaust gas purification system using the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for purifying nox in exhaust gas, it is a further objective to provide an exhaust gas purification system and a sulfur purge control method of the same capable of maintaining a catalyst temperature during sulfur purging and also capable of increasing the rate of sulfur dioxide (so2) by restricting the generation amount of hydrogen sulfide (h2s) during sulfur purge regeneration control.
a sulfur purge control method of an exhaust gas purification system for attaining the above objectives is provided with a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for occluding nox in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is lean, and releasing the occluded nox to reduce it in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is rich, and an oxidation catalyst in the upstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. the method is for executing a sulfur purge control for deterioration recovery caused by sulfur poisoning of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and the sulfur purge control is executed after the temperature difference between the inlet side and the outlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is in a temperature value not more than a given temperature value by raising the exhaust temperature.
moreover, the air fuel ratio state of the exhaust gas described in the above does not always mean an air fuel ratio state in a cylinder, but means a ratio of air amount to fuel amount supplied in the exhaust gas flowing in the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst (including the burned amount in the cylinder).
also, the oxidation catalyst may be placed on the upstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and may be a 2 brick type catalyst carrying the oxidation catalyst on the upstream area of the catalyst honeycomb and the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst on the downstream area of the catalyst honeycomb.
by this structure that the oxidation catalyst is disposed on the pre-stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, hydrocarbon (hc) reacts to the oxidized catalyst of the upstream area and the temperature of exhaust gas is raised. therefore, the exhaust gas has higher temperature than its activation temperature from steps before flowing in the post stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. for this reason, the post stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is uniformed in the catalyst temperature distribution, the catalyst is uniformly raised in temperature to sulfur resolution temperature in whole.
furthermore, before entering the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge, the system is controlled so as to enter the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge after it is confirmed that the temperature difference of the inlet area and the outlet area of the catalyst is within a given temperature difference, that is, after it is confirmed that the temperature distribution in the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is uniform. thereby, sulfur is separated from the catalyst certainly.
in the above sulfur purge control method of the exhaust gas purification system, the given temperature value is set to a range of 5Â° c. to 25Â° c., preferably 5Â° c. by this, equalization of the catalyst temperature distribution of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst can be realized with accuracy, and the sulfur purge is effectively performed.
also, the control whereby the air fuel ratio on the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is set to rich and the control whereby it is set to lean are alternately repeated when executing the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge.
furthermore, in the above sulfur purge control method of the exhaust gas purification system, the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of a target air fuel ratio of the inlet side is set to 0.85 to 0.95 for an air excess rate conversion on the rich side control and to 1.05 to 1.15 for an air excess rate conversion on the lean side control is performed.
in the sulfur purge control for sulfur poisoning recovery of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst (regeneration, sulfur purge), this air fuel ratio control method of the catalyst inlet side periodically repeats a rich state of the air fuel ratio of 0.85 to 0.95, preferably 0.9 for an air excess rate conversion on the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and a lean state of the air fuel ratio of 1.05 to 1.15, preferably 1.1. by this control, the reducing agent for raising the temperature of the exhaust gas can be sufficiently saved and at the same time the oxygen amount for oxidizing hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2) can be provided in the needed amount. moreover, these specific values have been obtained from experiments.
that is, at first the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is temporally set to a lean state of 1.05 to 1.15. by this, raising the temperature of the exhaust gas and the oxygen atmosphere is adequately made and it becomes possible to supply just the appropriate amount of oxygen for converting hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2) by oxidation. thus, hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is oxidized into sulfur dioxide (so2). therefore, it becomes possible to facilitate sulfur purging by sulfur dioxide (so2) and maintain the temperature during sulfur purge control by heat generated through oxidation. thereby, since the rate of sulfur dioxide (so2) is increased through restricting the generated amount of hydrogen sulfide (h2s) and the generated amount of sulfur dioxide (so2) is saved, the sulfur purge is completed early. thus, the sulfur purge control is completed in a short time.
moreover, in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above sulfur purge control method in the exhaust gas purification system, the target air fuel ratio of the inlet side is controlled by feedback control so that the air fuel ratio of the outlet side of the above nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is in a stoichiometric state during the sulfur purge control.
that is, the value of the Î» sensor is always controlled to a value not more than the stoichiometric amount in the outlet side (downstream side) of the catalyst, and the air fuel ratio of the inlet side or a target value in an interval between rich and lean is controlled by feedback control so as to maintain a stoichiometric air fuel ratio as a target value when slightly rich. by this, since it is not more than the stoichiometric air fuel ratio at all times after the middle stage of the catalyst, the sulfur purge becomes possible.
furthermore, in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above sulfur purge control method in the exhaust gas purification system, the rate of the control period for rich side control and lean side control is set to 5:2 to 4:3 for rich side control and lean side control respectively. by these controls, the rate of the reducing agent amount appropriate for the sulfur purge and the oxygen amount is adequately made, and sulfur can be efficiently purged while restricting the generation of hydrogen sulfide (h2s). more, these specific values have been obtained from experiments.

in the above exhaust gas purification system, sulfur purge control means feedback controls the target air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the above nox occlusion reduction type catalyst in such a way that the air fuel ratio of the outlet side thereof is in a stoichiometric state during sulfur purge control.
in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above exhaust gas purification system, the rate of control time of a rich control and a lean control is set to 5:2 to 4:3 for a rich side control time and a lean side control time respectively.

therefore, even if the sulfur purge operation is performed, since sulfur in the upstream area f in the catalyst having the temperature lower than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd is insufficient for its separation and release, catalyst performance is not recovered. besides, since catalyst activation is low, oxidation consumption of the catalyst surface and the inside of an occlusion agent becomes insufficient and the reduction atmosphere on the catalyst surface is insufficient. thus, the sulfur separation effect is extremely lowered and recovery of catalyst performance becomes impossible.
furthermore, the temperature of the midstream area m of the catalyst is higher than the sulfur separation resolution temperature tsd and lower than the catalyst thermal deterioration temperature tcd. since sulfur separation is effectively performed under a rich state of an air fuel ratio, the catalyst is recovered from sulfur poisoning.
however, in the downstream area a of the catalyst, its temperature ta also rises and becomes an abnormally extreme temperature above the catalyst thermal deterioration temperature tcd. thereby, the catalyst causes extreme thermal deterioration and its durability is extremely lowered.
on the other hand, if the catalyst temperature tc is raised up to the sulfur resolution temperature tsd in the upstream area f in the catalyst, the abnormally high temperature area where the temperature in the catalyst is higher than the catalyst thermal deterioration tcd extends due to the evenness of temperature distribution in the catalyst. as a result, the problem of extreme thermal deterioration and the problem of the enlargement of the area in which the durability of catalyst is extremely lowered, occur.
next, the problem of generation of hydrogen sulfide will be described below referring to fig. 9. fig. 9 is a view illustrating a time series of a sulfur purge control and shows a continuous rich control according to conventional technology on its left side.
if an oxide (o2) is not present upon sulfur purge control, sulfur connects with hydrogen (h2) and generates and emits the harmful gas of hydrogen sulfide (h2s). therefore, it is necessary to re-oxidize hydrogen sulfide (h2s) and to release sulfur as sulfur dioxide (so2). also, since heat generation depending on the oxidation reaction is small, the catalyst temperature lowers during sulfur purge. thus, the atmospheric condition that includes a small amount of oxygen (o2) necessary to oxidize hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is required.
if the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the catalyst is maintained in a rich state in which air fuel ratio is larger than theoretical air fuel ratio, the released sulfur dioxide (so2) and hydrocarbon (hc) of the reducing agent react due to insufficient oxygen and the generation rate of the noxious smelling hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is higher.
on the other hand, in the case where the oxygen concentration on the catalyst outlet side is maintained in a stoichiometric state, hydrogen sulfide (h2s) can be lowered as shown at the right end a of fig. 9. however, the amount of sulfur purge is equal to ??or less. thereby, sulfur purge control time for purging sulfur becomes longer. in this sulfur purge, the catalyst temperature is set to a high temperature of about 700Â° c. if sulfur purge control time becomes longer, problems such as high costs and catalyst deterioration are caused.
furthermore, regarding sulfur purge control for sulfur poisoning regeneration (recovery) of a nox catalyst, for example, in japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2000-170525, a exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine is proposed as follows. for effective improvement of sox release from an sox absorption agent (nox absorption agent), the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in the sox absorption agent is controlled so that the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas at the outlet of the sox absorption agent is in a stoichiometric air fuel ratio (stoichiometric). in this air fuel ratio control, at first the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in sox absorption agent is controlled in a rich state and then the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in is controlled to approach the stoichiometric air fuel ratio.
however, in this exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine in the case where the excess air rate Î» of the catalyst inlet side is maintained in a rich state not more than 1.0 so that the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas at the outlet of the sox absorption agent becomes a stoichiometric air fuel ratio (stoichiometric), oxygen is not sufficient. therefore, the released sulfur dioxide (so2) and hydrocarbon (hc) of the reducing agent react with each other, and hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is generated.
moreover, for example, japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2003-336518 (page 5) proposes the following exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine. in order to check the excess rich value of the air fuel ratio upon sulfur purge control, an electric control unit (ecu) executes fuel addition control (so called rich spike control) so that oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas flowing into a filter is lowered in a spike manner in a relatively short period in recovering the sox-poison.
however, this exhaust gas purifying device does not show a response of changing to hydrogen sulfide (h2s) from sulfur dioxide (so2) because of insufficient oxygen. also, for application, specific values of a rich and lean air fuel ratio, rich duration period, and lean duration period are required, but these specific combinations are not described.
the present invention is developed to resolve the above problems. in a exhaust gas purification system using a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for purifying nox in exhaust gas, it is the objective of the present invention to uniformly remove sulfur poisoning of a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst by uniformly maintaining a temperature of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst to that not less than the sulfur resolution temperature and performing air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge during sulfur purge regeneration control for sulfur poisoning regeneration. thereby, the durational period of the deterioration of a catalyst caused by sulfur poisoning is avoided and also its thermal deterioration is prevented in the downstream area in the catalyst from being at a high temperature. accordingly, it is its objective to provide an exhaust gas purification system and a sulfur purge control method of the same.
furthermore, in the exhaust gas purification system using the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for purifying nox in exhaust gas, it is a further objective to provide an exhaust gas purification system and a sulfur purge control method of the same capable of maintaining a catalyst temperature during sulfur purging and also capable of increasing the rate of sulfur dioxide (so2) by restricting the generation amount of hydrogen sulfide (h2s) during sulfur purge regeneration control.
a sulfur purge control method of an exhaust gas purification system for attaining the above objectives is provided with a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for occluding nox in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is lean, and releasing the occluded nox to reduce it in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is rich, and an oxidation catalyst in the upstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. the method is for executing a sulfur purge control for deterioration recovery caused by sulfur poisoning of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and the sulfur purge control is executed after the temperature difference between the inlet side and the outlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is in a temperature value not more than a given temperature value by raising the exhaust temperature.
moreover, the air fuel ratio state of the exhaust gas described in the above does not always mean an air fuel ratio state in a cylinder, but means a ratio of air amount to fuel amount supplied in the exhaust gas flowing in the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst (including the burned amount in the cylinder).
also, the oxidation catalyst may be placed on the upstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and may be a 2 brick type catalyst carrying the oxidation catalyst on the upstream area of the catalyst honeycomb and the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst on the downstream area of the catalyst honeycomb.
by this structure that the oxidation catalyst is disposed on the pre-stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, hydrocarbon (hc) reacts to the oxidized catalyst of the upstream area and the temperature of exhaust gas is raised. therefore, the exhaust gas has higher temperature than its activation temperature from steps before flowing in the post stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. for this reason, the post stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is uniformed in the catalyst temperature distribution, the catalyst is uniformly raised in temperature to sulfur resolution temperature in whole.
furthermore, before entering the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge, the system is controlled so as to enter the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge after it is confirmed that the temperature difference of the inlet area and the outlet area of the catalyst is within a given temperature difference, that is, after it is confirmed that the temperature distribution in the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is uniform. thereby, sulfur is separated from the catalyst certainly.
in the above sulfur purge control method of the exhaust gas purification system, the given temperature value is set to a range of 5Â° c. to 25Â° c., preferably 5Â° c. by this, equalization of the catalyst temperature distribution of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst can be realized with accuracy, and the sulfur purge is effectively performed.
also, the control whereby the air fuel ratio on the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is set to rich and the control whereby it is set to lean are alternately repeated when executing the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge.
furthermore, in the above sulfur purge control method of the exhaust gas purification system, the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of a target air fuel ratio of the inlet side is set to 0.85 to 0.95 for an air excess rate conversion on the rich side control and to 1.05 to 1.15 for an air excess rate conversion on the lean side control is performed.
in the sulfur purge control for sulfur poisoning recovery of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst (regeneration, sulfur purge), this air fuel ratio control method of the catalyst inlet side periodically repeats a rich state of the air fuel ratio of 0.85 to 0.95, preferably 0.9 for an air excess rate conversion on the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and a lean state of the air fuel ratio of 1.05 to 1.15, preferably 1.1. by this control, the reducing agent for raising the temperature of the exhaust gas can be sufficiently saved and at the same time the oxygen amount for oxidizing hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2) can be provided in the needed amount. moreover, these specific values have been obtained from experiments.
that is, at first the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is temporally set to a lean state of 1.05 to 1.15. by this, raising the temperature of the exhaust gas and the oxygen atmosphere is adequately made and it becomes possible to supply just the appropriate amount of oxygen for converting hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2) by oxidation. thus, hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is oxidized into sulfur dioxide (so2). therefore, it becomes possible to facilitate sulfur purging by sulfur dioxide (so2) and maintain the temperature during sulfur purge control by heat generated through oxidation. thereby, since the rate of sulfur dioxide (so2) is increased through restricting the generated amount of hydrogen sulfide (h2s) and the generated amount of sulfur dioxide (so2) is saved, the sulfur purge is completed early. thus, the sulfur purge control is completed in a short time.
moreover, in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above sulfur purge control method in the exhaust gas purification system, the target air fuel ratio of the inlet side is controlled by feedback control so that the air fuel ratio of the outlet side of the above nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is in a stoichiometric state during the sulfur purge control.
that is, the value of the Î» sensor is always controlled to a value not more than the stoichiometric amount in the outlet side (downstream side) of the catalyst, and the air fuel ratio of the inlet side or a target value in an interval between rich and lean is controlled by feedback control so as to maintain a stoichiometric air fuel ratio as a target value when slightly rich. by this, since it is not more than the stoichiometric air fuel ratio at all times after the middle stage of the catalyst, the sulfur purge becomes possible.
furthermore, in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above sulfur purge control method in the exhaust gas purification system, the rate of the control period for rich side control and lean side control is set to 5:2 to 4:3 for rich side control and lean side control respectively. by these controls, the rate of the reducing agent amount appropriate for the sulfur purge and the oxygen amount is adequately made, and sulfur can be efficiently purged while restricting the generation of hydrogen sulfide (h2s). more, these specific values have been obtained from experiments.
an exhaust gas purification system for offering the above objective is provided with a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for occluding nox in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is lean, and releasing the occluded nox to reduce it in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is rich, an oxidation catalyst disposed in the upstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and a sulfur purge control means executing a sulfur purge control for recovering the deterioration caused by sulfur poisoning of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. the sulfur purge control means is constituted to execute the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge when executing the sulfur purge control after a temperature difference between the inlet side and the outlet side reaches a given temperature value or less, by raising exhaust gas temperature.
furthermore, in the above exhaust gas purification system, the given temperature value is set to a temperature range of 5Â° c. to 25Â° c., preferably 5Â° c. also, the sulfur purge control means constituted to alternately repeat a rich side control whereby the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is rich, and a lean side control where it is lean.
furthermore, in the above exhaust gas purification system, the sulfur purge control method is constituted to set the target air fuel ratio of the inlet side to 0.85 to 0.95 for an air excess rate conversion in the rich side control, and to 1.05 to 1.15 for an air excess rate conversion in the lean side control.
in the above exhaust gas purification system, sulfur purge control means feedback controls the target air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the above nox occlusion reduction type catalyst in such a way that the air fuel ratio of the outlet side thereof is in a stoichiometric state during sulfur purge control.
in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above exhaust gas purification system, the rate of control time of a rich control and a lean control is set to 5:2 to 4:3 for a rich side control time and a lean side control time respectively.
as mentioned in the above, in the exhaust gas purification system and the sulfur purge control method using the same according to the present invention, the sulfur poisoning of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is uniformly removed by executing the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge after uniformly raising the temperature of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst not lower than the sulfur resolution temperature. by this, the durational period deterioration caused by sulfur poisoning can be avoided and the back side of the catalyst can be prevented from a partial temperature rise during sulfur purge control. therefore, thermal deterioration caused by partial high temperatures can be prevented, so the durational deterioration can be suppressed by thermal deterioration.
furthermore, since the air fuel ratio at the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is periodically repeated between a rich state of 0.85 to 0.95 and a lean state of 1.05 to 1.15 for an excess air rate conversion and is feedback controlled to be in a stoichiometric state on the downstream of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, a reducing agent necessary for raising the exhaust gas temperature can be certainly saved, and at the same time it is possible to provide an oxygen amount necessary for oxidizing hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2).
that is, oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2) can be certainly attained by not maintaining the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst in rich state, and intermittently repeating a lean state. and at the same time, sulfur purge can be facilitated and a high temperature for sulfur purge can be maintained.
by this, an oxygen atmosphere and exhaust gas temperature are made to be appropriate, the rate of sulfur dioxide (so2) is higher restraining the generated amount of oxidizing hydrogen sulfide (h2s), and the generated sulfur purge amount can be saved. therefore, since sulfur purge can be completed early, sulfur purge control can be finished in a short time.",4,problem,generation of hydrogen sulfide,1.0,exact,2
US07669410,sulfur purge control method for exhaust gas purifying system and exhaust gas purifying system,"in an exhaust gas purifying system which is equipped with an nox occlusion reduction type catalyst (?œnox catalyst?? and an oxidation catalyst set on the upstream side of the nox catalyst, and in which sulfur purge control for regenerating the sulfur-poisoned catalyst is conducted, an air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge is conducted when a temperature difference between an inlet side and an outlet side of the nox catalyst is outside a given range. sulfur poison on the nox catalyst can be uniformly removed in sulfur-purge regeneration control, thereby extending the service life of the nox catalyst. further, the nox catalyst can be protected from thermal deterioration caused by partial temperature rise inside the nox catalyst on its downstream side, so that the service life of the nox catalyst can also be extended.","the present invention relates to an exhaust gas purification system provided with a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for reducing and purifying nox (nitrogen oxides) in exhaust gas of an interval combustion engine, and to a sulfur purge control method of the same.
nox catalysts for reducing and removing nox from exhaust gas of various combustion devices such as internal combustion engines of diesel engines, some gasoline engines, are researched and proposed. one of them is a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst as a nox lowering catalyst for diesel engines. this catalyst can effectively purify nox in exhaust gas by use of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst.
for example, the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst has the following catalyst reaction function as shown in japanese patent application kokai publication no. 1998-30430. the catalyst makes a nox metal such as barium (ba) having the property of occluding nox, occlude no2 after oxidizing no (nitric oxide) into no2 (nitrogen dioxide) in the case of an air-fuel ratio in a lean-state. then, a nox regeneration control for realizing a rich-state of an air-fuel ratio is executed, thereby the no2 is inversely released from the occlusion material and the no2 is purified through ternary function by using a hc (hydrocarbon), co (carbon monoxide).
this nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is a catalyst of a type mainly carrying precious metals for facilitating an oxidation-reduction reaction and nox occlusion material (nox occlusion substance) having the function of occluding and releasing nox on a catalyst carrier such as alumina. the precious metal is platinum (pt) or palladium (pd), etc. the nox occlusion material is alkali earth metal such as barium (ba).
in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in is lean and oxygen (o2) exists in the atmosphere, the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst oxidizes nitric oxide (no) in the exhaust gas by precious metals into nitrogen dioxide (no2), and the oxidized no2 is accumulated in the nox occlusion material as a nitrate salt (ba2no4 etc.).
moreover, in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in is a stoichiometric air fuel ratio or in a rich state (low oxide concentration) and oxygen is not present in the atmosphere, the nox occlusion material such as barium (ba) is connected to carbon monoxide (co) and nitrogen dioxide (no2) is resolved and released from the nitrate salt. this released nitrogen dioxide (no2) is reduced by unburned hydrocarbon (hc) or carbon monoxide (co) etc contained in the exhaust gas through a three-way function of the precious metal group and becomes a nitride (n2). thereby, the various components contained in the exhaust gas are released into the atmosphere as harmless substances such as carbon dioxide (co2), water (h2o), nitride (n2).
therefore, the exhaust gas purification system with the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst executes a nox regenerating operation which performs a rich control of the air fuel ratio for regenerating the nox occlusion ability when its nox occlusion ability approaches saturation. thus, the absorbed nox is released and the released nox is reduced through a precious metal catalyst.
however, there is the problem that its performance is deteriorated by sulfur poisoning of this nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. that is, sulfur contained in fuel becomes sulfur dioxide (so2) through burning, is occluded in the occlusion material in the same manner as nitrogen dioxide (no2), and generates a sulfate such as barium sulfate (ba2so4). thereby, the occlusion ability of nitrogen dioxide (no2) decreases.
therefore, in order to maintain the initial catalyst purifying performance, adding to recover the nox occlusion ability by nox regeneration control, it is necessary to separate sulfur absorbed and occluded in catalyst and to cause it to be released. this separation and release of sulfur requires a higher temperature than a certain temperature and a reduction atmosphere in the exhaust gas content. thus, an environment that facilitates the resolution of the sulfate is required by performing sulfur purge control for an atmosphere of a rich state of an air fuel ratio.
for example, as disclosed in japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2003-500594, japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2003-336518, japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2004-92445, sulfate is not resolved and is not released, if a rich condition at a high temperature of about 600Â° c. to 700Â° c. is not attained. moreover, for oxide concentration, since a reducing agent such as a hydrocarbon (hc) or carbon monoxide (co) uses an oxide (o2) for oxidization, resolution of the sulfate (ba2 so4 etc.) is not facilitated and sulfur purge is not caused.
in conventional technology, a method for raising the exhaust gas temperature to a sulfur resolution temperature (sulfur purgeable temperature) includes a post injection method with fuel injection inside a cylinder and a direct fuel addition method in an exhaust pipe. further, on the engine side, heat capacity of the exhaust gas is lowered through decreasing the flow-volume of the exhaust gas by an intake throttle etc.
however, in this sulfur purge control, there is the problem of evenness of temperature in the catalyst and the problem of generation of hydrogen sulfide.
the problem of evenness of temperature in the catalyst will be described referring to fig. 13 and fig. 14. fig. 13 shows a temperature distribution in a catalyst, and fig. 14 shows a time series of catalyst temperatures. in fig. 14, s shows the amount of sulfur purge, and Î» shows the air excess rate. also, tf, tm, and ta show catalyst temperatures on the upstream side, midstream side and downstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst respectively.
the conventional technological method for raising the temperature cannot make the temperature distribution inside a catalyst uniform in a rich process of taking a reduction atmosphere of exhaust gas content after raising the temperature of the catalyst as shown in fig. 13 and fig. 14. that is, the temperature of the upstream area f in the catalyst cannot be raised higher than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd, and the temperature tf enters a low temperature area less than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd. on the other hand, the midstream area m and the downstream area a in the catalyst only become higher than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd.
therefore, even if the sulfur purge operation is performed, since sulfur in the upstream area f in the catalyst having the temperature lower than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd is insufficient for its separation and release, catalyst performance is not recovered. besides, since catalyst activation is low, oxidation consumption of the catalyst surface and the inside of an occlusion agent becomes insufficient and the reduction atmosphere on the catalyst surface is insufficient. thus, the sulfur separation effect is extremely lowered and recovery of catalyst performance becomes impossible.
furthermore, the temperature of the midstream area m of the catalyst is higher than the sulfur separation resolution temperature tsd and lower than the catalyst thermal deterioration temperature tcd. since sulfur separation is effectively performed under a rich state of an air fuel ratio, the catalyst is recovered from sulfur poisoning.
however, in the downstream area a of the catalyst, its temperature ta also rises and becomes an abnormally extreme temperature above the catalyst thermal deterioration temperature tcd. thereby, the catalyst causes extreme thermal deterioration and its durability is extremely lowered.
on the other hand, if the catalyst temperature tc is raised up to the sulfur resolution temperature tsd in the upstream area f in the catalyst, the abnormally high temperature area where the temperature in the catalyst is higher than the catalyst thermal deterioration tcd extends due to the evenness of temperature distribution in the catalyst. as a result, the problem of extreme thermal deterioration and the problem of the enlargement of the area in which the durability of catalyst is extremely lowered, occur.
next, the problem of generation of hydrogen sulfide will be described below referring to fig. 9. fig. 9 is a view illustrating a time series of a sulfur purge control and shows a continuous rich control according to conventional technology on its left side.
if an oxide (o2) is not present upon sulfur purge control, sulfur connects with hydrogen (h2) and generates and emits the harmful gas of hydrogen sulfide (h2s). therefore, it is necessary to re-oxidize hydrogen sulfide (h2s) and to release sulfur as sulfur dioxide (so2). also, since heat generation depending on the oxidation reaction is small, the catalyst temperature lowers during sulfur purge. thus, the atmospheric condition that includes a small amount of oxygen (o2) necessary to oxidize hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is required.
if the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the catalyst is maintained in a rich state in which air fuel ratio is larger than theoretical air fuel ratio, the released sulfur dioxide (so2) and hydrocarbon (hc) of the reducing agent react due to insufficient oxygen and the generation rate of the noxious smelling hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is higher.
on the other hand, in the case where the oxygen concentration on the catalyst outlet side is maintained in a stoichiometric state, hydrogen sulfide (h2s) can be lowered as shown at the right end a of fig. 9. however, the amount of sulfur purge is equal to ??or less. thereby, sulfur purge control time for purging sulfur becomes longer. in this sulfur purge, the catalyst temperature is set to a high temperature of about 700Â° c. if sulfur purge control time becomes longer, problems such as high costs and catalyst deterioration are caused.
furthermore, regarding sulfur purge control for sulfur poisoning regeneration (recovery) of a nox catalyst, for example, in japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2000-170525, a exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine is proposed as follows. for effective improvement of sox release from an sox absorption agent (nox absorption agent), the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in the sox absorption agent is controlled so that the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas at the outlet of the sox absorption agent is in a stoichiometric air fuel ratio (stoichiometric). in this air fuel ratio control, at first the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in sox absorption agent is controlled in a rich state and then the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in is controlled to approach the stoichiometric air fuel ratio.
however, in this exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine in the case where the excess air rate Î» of the catalyst inlet side is maintained in a rich state not more than 1.0 so that the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas at the outlet of the sox absorption agent becomes a stoichiometric air fuel ratio (stoichiometric), oxygen is not sufficient. therefore, the released sulfur dioxide (so2) and hydrocarbon (hc) of the reducing agent react with each other, and hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is generated.
moreover, for example, japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2003-336518 (page 5) proposes the following exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine. in order to check the excess rich value of the air fuel ratio upon sulfur purge control, an electric control unit (ecu) executes fuel addition control (so called rich spike control) so that oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas flowing into a filter is lowered in a spike manner in a relatively short period in recovering the sox-poison.

moreover, the air fuel ratio state of the exhaust gas described in the above does not always mean an air fuel ratio state in a cylinder, but means a ratio of air amount to fuel amount supplied in the exhaust gas flowing in the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst (including the burned amount in the cylinder).
also, the oxidation catalyst may be placed on the upstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and may be a 2 brick type catalyst carrying the oxidation catalyst on the upstream area of the catalyst honeycomb and the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst on the downstream area of the catalyst honeycomb.
by this structure that the oxidation catalyst is disposed on the pre-stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, hydrocarbon (hc) reacts to the oxidized catalyst of the upstream area and the temperature of exhaust gas is raised. therefore, the exhaust gas has higher temperature than its activation temperature from steps before flowing in the post stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. for this reason, the post stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is uniformed in the catalyst temperature distribution, the catalyst is uniformly raised in temperature to sulfur resolution temperature in whole.
furthermore, before entering the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge, the system is controlled so as to enter the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge after it is confirmed that the temperature difference of the inlet area and the outlet area of the catalyst is within a given temperature difference, that is, after it is confirmed that the temperature distribution in the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is uniform. thereby, sulfur is separated from the catalyst certainly.
in the above sulfur purge control method of the exhaust gas purification system, the given temperature value is set to a range of 5Â° c. to 25Â° c., preferably 5Â° c. by this, equalization of the catalyst temperature distribution of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst can be realized with accuracy, and the sulfur purge is effectively performed.
also, the control whereby the air fuel ratio on the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is set to rich and the control whereby it is set to lean are alternately repeated when executing the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge.
furthermore, in the above sulfur purge control method of the exhaust gas purification system, the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of a target air fuel ratio of the inlet side is set to 0.85 to 0.95 for an air excess rate conversion on the rich side control and to 1.05 to 1.15 for an air excess rate conversion on the lean side control is performed.
in the sulfur purge control for sulfur poisoning recovery of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst (regeneration, sulfur purge), this air fuel ratio control method of the catalyst inlet side periodically repeats a rich state of the air fuel ratio of 0.85 to 0.95, preferably 0.9 for an air excess rate conversion on the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and a lean state of the air fuel ratio of 1.05 to 1.15, preferably 1.1. by this control, the reducing agent for raising the temperature of the exhaust gas can be sufficiently saved and at the same time the oxygen amount for oxidizing hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2) can be provided in the needed amount. moreover, these specific values have been obtained from experiments.

moreover, in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above sulfur purge control method in the exhaust gas purification system, the target air fuel ratio of the inlet side is controlled by feedback control so that the air fuel ratio of the outlet side of the above nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is in a stoichiometric state during the sulfur purge control.
that is, the value of the Î» sensor is always controlled to a value not more than the stoichiometric amount in the outlet side (downstream side) of the catalyst, and the air fuel ratio of the inlet side or a target value in an interval between rich and lean is controlled by feedback control so as to maintain a stoichiometric air fuel ratio as a target value when slightly rich. by this, since it is not more than the stoichiometric air fuel ratio at all times after the middle stage of the catalyst, the sulfur purge becomes possible.
furthermore, in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above sulfur purge control method in the exhaust gas purification system, the rate of the control period for rich side control and lean side control is set to 5:2 to 4:3 for rich side control and lean side control respectively. by these controls, the rate of the reducing agent amount appropriate for the sulfur purge and the oxygen amount is adequately made, and sulfur can be efficiently purged while restricting the generation of hydrogen sulfide (h2s). more, these specific values have been obtained from experiments.
an exhaust gas purification system for offering the above objective is provided with a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for occluding nox in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is lean, and releasing the occluded nox to reduce it in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is rich, an oxidation catalyst disposed in the upstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and a sulfur purge control means executing a sulfur purge control for recovering the deterioration caused by sulfur poisoning of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. the sulfur purge control means is constituted to execute the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge when executing the sulfur purge control after a temperature difference between the inlet side and the outlet side reaches a given temperature value or less, by raising exhaust gas temperature.
furthermore, in the above exhaust gas purification system, the given temperature value is set to a temperature range of 5Â° c. to 25Â° c., preferably 5Â° c. also, the sulfur purge control means constituted to alternately repeat a rich side control whereby the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is rich, and a lean side control where it is lean.
furthermore, in the above exhaust gas purification system, the sulfur purge control method is constituted to set the target air fuel ratio of the inlet side to 0.85 to 0.95 for an air excess rate conversion in the rich side control, and to 1.05 to 1.15 for an air excess rate conversion in the lean side control.
in the above exhaust gas purification system, sulfur purge control means feedback controls the target air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the above nox occlusion reduction type catalyst in such a way that the air fuel ratio of the outlet side thereof is in a stoichiometric state during sulfur purge control.
in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above exhaust gas purification system, the rate of control time of a rich control and a lean control is set to 5:2 to 4:3 for a rich side control time and a lean side control time respectively.
as mentioned in the above, in the exhaust gas purification system and the sulfur purge control method using the same according to the present invention, the sulfur poisoning of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is uniformly removed by executing the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge after uniformly raising the temperature of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst not lower than the sulfur resolution temperature. by this, the durational period deterioration caused by sulfur poisoning can be avoided and the back side of the catalyst can be prevented from a partial temperature rise during sulfur purge control. therefore, thermal deterioration caused by partial high temperatures can be prevented, so the durational deterioration can be suppressed by thermal deterioration.
furthermore, since the air fuel ratio at the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is periodically repeated between a rich state of 0.85 to 0.95 and a lean state of 1.05 to 1.15 for an excess air rate conversion and is feedback controlled to be in a stoichiometric state on the downstream of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, a reducing agent necessary for raising the exhaust gas temperature can be certainly saved, and at the same time it is possible to provide an oxygen amount necessary for oxidizing hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2).
that is, oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2) can be certainly attained by not maintaining the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst in rich state, and intermittently repeating a lean state. and at the same time, sulfur purge can be facilitated and a high temperature for sulfur purge can be maintained.
by this, an oxygen atmosphere and exhaust gas temperature are made to be appropriate, the rate of sulfur dioxide (so2) is higher restraining the generated amount of oxidizing hydrogen sulfide (h2s), and the generated sulfur purge amount can be saved. therefore, since sulfur purge can be completed early, sulfur purge control can be finished in a short time.",5,problem,extreme thermal deterioration of catalyst,1.0,partial,0
US07669410,sulfur purge control method for exhaust gas purifying system and exhaust gas purifying system,"in an exhaust gas purifying system which is equipped with an nox occlusion reduction type catalyst (?œnox catalyst?? and an oxidation catalyst set on the upstream side of the nox catalyst, and in which sulfur purge control for regenerating the sulfur-poisoned catalyst is conducted, an air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge is conducted when a temperature difference between an inlet side and an outlet side of the nox catalyst is outside a given range. sulfur poison on the nox catalyst can be uniformly removed in sulfur-purge regeneration control, thereby extending the service life of the nox catalyst. further, the nox catalyst can be protected from thermal deterioration caused by partial temperature rise inside the nox catalyst on its downstream side, so that the service life of the nox catalyst can also be extended.","the present invention relates to an exhaust gas purification system provided with a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for reducing and purifying nox (nitrogen oxides) in exhaust gas of an interval combustion engine, and to a sulfur purge control method of the same.
nox catalysts for reducing and removing nox from exhaust gas of various combustion devices such as internal combustion engines of diesel engines, some gasoline engines, are researched and proposed. one of them is a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst as a nox lowering catalyst for diesel engines. this catalyst can effectively purify nox in exhaust gas by use of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst.
for example, the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst has the following catalyst reaction function as shown in japanese patent application kokai publication no. 1998-30430. the catalyst makes a nox metal such as barium (ba) having the property of occluding nox, occlude no2 after oxidizing no (nitric oxide) into no2 (nitrogen dioxide) in the case of an air-fuel ratio in a lean-state. then, a nox regeneration control for realizing a rich-state of an air-fuel ratio is executed, thereby the no2 is inversely released from the occlusion material and the no2 is purified through ternary function by using a hc (hydrocarbon), co (carbon monoxide).
this nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is a catalyst of a type mainly carrying precious metals for facilitating an oxidation-reduction reaction and nox occlusion material (nox occlusion substance) having the function of occluding and releasing nox on a catalyst carrier such as alumina. the precious metal is platinum (pt) or palladium (pd), etc. the nox occlusion material is alkali earth metal such as barium (ba).
in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in is lean and oxygen (o2) exists in the atmosphere, the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst oxidizes nitric oxide (no) in the exhaust gas by precious metals into nitrogen dioxide (no2), and the oxidized no2 is accumulated in the nox occlusion material as a nitrate salt (ba2no4 etc.).
moreover, in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in is a stoichiometric air fuel ratio or in a rich state (low oxide concentration) and oxygen is not present in the atmosphere, the nox occlusion material such as barium (ba) is connected to carbon monoxide (co) and nitrogen dioxide (no2) is resolved and released from the nitrate salt. this released nitrogen dioxide (no2) is reduced by unburned hydrocarbon (hc) or carbon monoxide (co) etc contained in the exhaust gas through a three-way function of the precious metal group and becomes a nitride (n2). thereby, the various components contained in the exhaust gas are released into the atmosphere as harmless substances such as carbon dioxide (co2), water (h2o), nitride (n2).
therefore, the exhaust gas purification system with the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst executes a nox regenerating operation which performs a rich control of the air fuel ratio for regenerating the nox occlusion ability when its nox occlusion ability approaches saturation. thus, the absorbed nox is released and the released nox is reduced through a precious metal catalyst.
however, there is the problem that its performance is deteriorated by sulfur poisoning of this nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. that is, sulfur contained in fuel becomes sulfur dioxide (so2) through burning, is occluded in the occlusion material in the same manner as nitrogen dioxide (no2), and generates a sulfate such as barium sulfate (ba2so4). thereby, the occlusion ability of nitrogen dioxide (no2) decreases.
therefore, in order to maintain the initial catalyst purifying performance, adding to recover the nox occlusion ability by nox regeneration control, it is necessary to separate sulfur absorbed and occluded in catalyst and to cause it to be released. this separation and release of sulfur requires a higher temperature than a certain temperature and a reduction atmosphere in the exhaust gas content. thus, an environment that facilitates the resolution of the sulfate is required by performing sulfur purge control for an atmosphere of a rich state of an air fuel ratio.
for example, as disclosed in japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2003-500594, japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2003-336518, japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2004-92445, sulfate is not resolved and is not released, if a rich condition at a high temperature of about 600Â° c. to 700Â° c. is not attained. moreover, for oxide concentration, since a reducing agent such as a hydrocarbon (hc) or carbon monoxide (co) uses an oxide (o2) for oxidization, resolution of the sulfate (ba2 so4 etc.) is not facilitated and sulfur purge is not caused.
in conventional technology, a method for raising the exhaust gas temperature to a sulfur resolution temperature (sulfur purgeable temperature) includes a post injection method with fuel injection inside a cylinder and a direct fuel addition method in an exhaust pipe. further, on the engine side, heat capacity of the exhaust gas is lowered through decreasing the flow-volume of the exhaust gas by an intake throttle etc.
however, in this sulfur purge control, there is the problem of evenness of temperature in the catalyst and the problem of generation of hydrogen sulfide.
the problem of evenness of temperature in the catalyst will be described referring to fig. 13 and fig. 14. fig. 13 shows a temperature distribution in a catalyst, and fig. 14 shows a time series of catalyst temperatures. in fig. 14, s shows the amount of sulfur purge, and Î» shows the air excess rate. also, tf, tm, and ta show catalyst temperatures on the upstream side, midstream side and downstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst respectively.
the conventional technological method for raising the temperature cannot make the temperature distribution inside a catalyst uniform in a rich process of taking a reduction atmosphere of exhaust gas content after raising the temperature of the catalyst as shown in fig. 13 and fig. 14. that is, the temperature of the upstream area f in the catalyst cannot be raised higher than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd, and the temperature tf enters a low temperature area less than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd. on the other hand, the midstream area m and the downstream area a in the catalyst only become higher than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd.
therefore, even if the sulfur purge operation is performed, since sulfur in the upstream area f in the catalyst having the temperature lower than the sulfur resolution temperature tsd is insufficient for its separation and release, catalyst performance is not recovered. besides, since catalyst activation is low, oxidation consumption of the catalyst surface and the inside of an occlusion agent becomes insufficient and the reduction atmosphere on the catalyst surface is insufficient. thus, the sulfur separation effect is extremely lowered and recovery of catalyst performance becomes impossible.
furthermore, the temperature of the midstream area m of the catalyst is higher than the sulfur separation resolution temperature tsd and lower than the catalyst thermal deterioration temperature tcd. since sulfur separation is effectively performed under a rich state of an air fuel ratio, the catalyst is recovered from sulfur poisoning.
however, in the downstream area a of the catalyst, its temperature ta also rises and becomes an abnormally extreme temperature above the catalyst thermal deterioration temperature tcd. thereby, the catalyst causes extreme thermal deterioration and its durability is extremely lowered.
on the other hand, if the catalyst temperature tc is raised up to the sulfur resolution temperature tsd in the upstream area f in the catalyst, the abnormally high temperature area where the temperature in the catalyst is higher than the catalyst thermal deterioration tcd extends due to the evenness of temperature distribution in the catalyst. as a result, the problem of extreme thermal deterioration and the problem of the enlargement of the area in which the durability of catalyst is extremely lowered, occur.
next, the problem of generation of hydrogen sulfide will be described below referring to fig. 9. fig. 9 is a view illustrating a time series of a sulfur purge control and shows a continuous rich control according to conventional technology on its left side.
if an oxide (o2) is not present upon sulfur purge control, sulfur connects with hydrogen (h2) and generates and emits the harmful gas of hydrogen sulfide (h2s). therefore, it is necessary to re-oxidize hydrogen sulfide (h2s) and to release sulfur as sulfur dioxide (so2). also, since heat generation depending on the oxidation reaction is small, the catalyst temperature lowers during sulfur purge. thus, the atmospheric condition that includes a small amount of oxygen (o2) necessary to oxidize hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is required.
if the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the catalyst is maintained in a rich state in which air fuel ratio is larger than theoretical air fuel ratio, the released sulfur dioxide (so2) and hydrocarbon (hc) of the reducing agent react due to insufficient oxygen and the generation rate of the noxious smelling hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is higher.
on the other hand, in the case where the oxygen concentration on the catalyst outlet side is maintained in a stoichiometric state, hydrogen sulfide (h2s) can be lowered as shown at the right end a of fig. 9. however, the amount of sulfur purge is equal to ??or less. thereby, sulfur purge control time for purging sulfur becomes longer. in this sulfur purge, the catalyst temperature is set to a high temperature of about 700Â° c. if sulfur purge control time becomes longer, problems such as high costs and catalyst deterioration are caused.
furthermore, regarding sulfur purge control for sulfur poisoning regeneration (recovery) of a nox catalyst, for example, in japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2000-170525, a exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine is proposed as follows. for effective improvement of sox release from an sox absorption agent (nox absorption agent), the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in the sox absorption agent is controlled so that the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas at the outlet of the sox absorption agent is in a stoichiometric air fuel ratio (stoichiometric). in this air fuel ratio control, at first the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in sox absorption agent is controlled in a rich state and then the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing in is controlled to approach the stoichiometric air fuel ratio.
however, in this exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine in the case where the excess air rate Î» of the catalyst inlet side is maintained in a rich state not more than 1.0 so that the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas at the outlet of the sox absorption agent becomes a stoichiometric air fuel ratio (stoichiometric), oxygen is not sufficient. therefore, the released sulfur dioxide (so2) and hydrocarbon (hc) of the reducing agent react with each other, and hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is generated.
moreover, for example, japanese patent application kokai publication no. 2003-336518 (page 5) proposes the following exhaust gas purifying device of an internal combustion engine. in order to check the excess rich value of the air fuel ratio upon sulfur purge control, an electric control unit (ecu) executes fuel addition control (so called rich spike control) so that oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas flowing into a filter is lowered in a spike manner in a relatively short period in recovering the sox-poison.
however, this exhaust gas purifying device does not show a response of changing to hydrogen sulfide (h2s) from sulfur dioxide (so2) because of insufficient oxygen. also, for application, specific values of a rich and lean air fuel ratio, rich duration period, and lean duration period are required, but these specific combinations are not described.
the present invention is developed to resolve the above problems. in a exhaust gas purification system using a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for purifying nox in exhaust gas, it is the objective of the present invention to uniformly remove sulfur poisoning of a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst by uniformly maintaining a temperature of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst to that not less than the sulfur resolution temperature and performing air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge during sulfur purge regeneration control for sulfur poisoning regeneration. thereby, the durational period of the deterioration of a catalyst caused by sulfur poisoning is avoided and also its thermal deterioration is prevented in the downstream area in the catalyst from being at a high temperature. accordingly, it is its objective to provide an exhaust gas purification system and a sulfur purge control method of the same.
furthermore, in the exhaust gas purification system using the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for purifying nox in exhaust gas, it is a further objective to provide an exhaust gas purification system and a sulfur purge control method of the same capable of maintaining a catalyst temperature during sulfur purging and also capable of increasing the rate of sulfur dioxide (so2) by restricting the generation amount of hydrogen sulfide (h2s) during sulfur purge regeneration control.
a sulfur purge control method of an exhaust gas purification system for attaining the above objectives is provided with a nox occlusion reduction type catalyst for occluding nox in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is lean, and releasing the occluded nox to reduce it in the case where the air fuel ratio of the exhaust gas is rich, and an oxidation catalyst in the upstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. the method is for executing a sulfur purge control for deterioration recovery caused by sulfur poisoning of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and the sulfur purge control is executed after the temperature difference between the inlet side and the outlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is in a temperature value not more than a given temperature value by raising the exhaust temperature.
moreover, the air fuel ratio state of the exhaust gas described in the above does not always mean an air fuel ratio state in a cylinder, but means a ratio of air amount to fuel amount supplied in the exhaust gas flowing in the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst (including the burned amount in the cylinder).
also, the oxidation catalyst may be placed on the upstream side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and may be a 2 brick type catalyst carrying the oxidation catalyst on the upstream area of the catalyst honeycomb and the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst on the downstream area of the catalyst honeycomb.
by this structure that the oxidation catalyst is disposed on the pre-stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, hydrocarbon (hc) reacts to the oxidized catalyst of the upstream area and the temperature of exhaust gas is raised. therefore, the exhaust gas has higher temperature than its activation temperature from steps before flowing in the post stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst. for this reason, the post stage of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is uniformed in the catalyst temperature distribution, the catalyst is uniformly raised in temperature to sulfur resolution temperature in whole.
furthermore, before entering the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge, the system is controlled so as to enter the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge after it is confirmed that the temperature difference of the inlet area and the outlet area of the catalyst is within a given temperature difference, that is, after it is confirmed that the temperature distribution in the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is uniform. thereby, sulfur is separated from the catalyst certainly.
in the above sulfur purge control method of the exhaust gas purification system, the given temperature value is set to a range of 5Â° c. to 25Â° c., preferably 5Â° c. by this, equalization of the catalyst temperature distribution of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst can be realized with accuracy, and the sulfur purge is effectively performed.
also, the control whereby the air fuel ratio on the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is set to rich and the control whereby it is set to lean are alternately repeated when executing the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge.
furthermore, in the above sulfur purge control method of the exhaust gas purification system, the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of a target air fuel ratio of the inlet side is set to 0.85 to 0.95 for an air excess rate conversion on the rich side control and to 1.05 to 1.15 for an air excess rate conversion on the lean side control is performed.
in the sulfur purge control for sulfur poisoning recovery of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst (regeneration, sulfur purge), this air fuel ratio control method of the catalyst inlet side periodically repeats a rich state of the air fuel ratio of 0.85 to 0.95, preferably 0.9 for an air excess rate conversion on the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst, and a lean state of the air fuel ratio of 1.05 to 1.15, preferably 1.1. by this control, the reducing agent for raising the temperature of the exhaust gas can be sufficiently saved and at the same time the oxygen amount for oxidizing hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2) can be provided in the needed amount. moreover, these specific values have been obtained from experiments.
that is, at first the air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is temporally set to a lean state of 1.05 to 1.15. by this, raising the temperature of the exhaust gas and the oxygen atmosphere is adequately made and it becomes possible to supply just the appropriate amount of oxygen for converting hydrogen sulfide (h2s) into sulfur dioxide (so2) by oxidation. thus, hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is oxidized into sulfur dioxide (so2). therefore, it becomes possible to facilitate sulfur purging by sulfur dioxide (so2) and maintain the temperature during sulfur purge control by heat generated through oxidation. thereby, since the rate of sulfur dioxide (so2) is increased through restricting the generated amount of hydrogen sulfide (h2s) and the generated amount of sulfur dioxide (so2) is saved, the sulfur purge is completed early. thus, the sulfur purge control is completed in a short time.
moreover, in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above sulfur purge control method in the exhaust gas purification system, the target air fuel ratio of the inlet side is controlled by feedback control so that the air fuel ratio of the outlet side of the above nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is in a stoichiometric state during the sulfur purge control.
that is, the value of the Î» sensor is always controlled to a value not more than the stoichiometric amount in the outlet side (downstream side) of the catalyst, and the air fuel ratio of the inlet side or a target value in an interval between rich and lean is controlled by feedback control so as to maintain a stoichiometric air fuel ratio as a target value when slightly rich. by this, since it is not more than the stoichiometric air fuel ratio at all times after the middle stage of the catalyst, the sulfur purge becomes possible.
furthermore, in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above sulfur purge control method in the exhaust gas purification system, the rate of the control period for rich side control and lean side control is set to 5:2 to 4:3 for rich side control and lean side control respectively. by these controls, the rate of the reducing agent amount appropriate for the sulfur purge and the oxygen amount is adequately made, and sulfur can be efficiently purged while restricting the generation of hydrogen sulfide (h2s). more, these specific values have been obtained from experiments.

in the above exhaust gas purification system, sulfur purge control means feedback controls the target air fuel ratio of the inlet side of the above nox occlusion reduction type catalyst in such a way that the air fuel ratio of the outlet side thereof is in a stoichiometric state during sulfur purge control.
in the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge of the above exhaust gas purification system, the rate of control time of a rich control and a lean control is set to 5:2 to 4:3 for a rich side control time and a lean side control time respectively.
as mentioned in the above, in the exhaust gas purification system and the sulfur purge control method using the same according to the present invention, the sulfur poisoning of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst is uniformly removed by executing the air fuel ratio control for sulfur purge after uniformly raising the temperature of the nox occlusion reduction type catalyst not lower than the sulfur resolution temperature. by this, the durational period deterioration caused by sulfur poisoning can be avoided and the back side of the catalyst can be prevented from a partial temperature rise during sulfur purge control. therefore, thermal deterioration caused by partial high temperatures can be prevented, so the durational deterioration can be suppressed by thermal deterioration.

by this, an oxygen atmosphere and exhaust gas temperature are made to be appropriate, the rate of sulfur dioxide (so2) is higher restraining the generated amount of oxidizing hydrogen sulfide (h2s), and the generated sulfur purge amount can be saved. therefore, since sulfur purge can be completed early, sulfur purge control can be finished in a short time.",6,problem,high costs and catalyst deterioration,1.0,exact,0

a honeycomb structure made of a ceramic has been used in a catalyst carrier for an internal combustion engine, a boiler, a chemical reaction device, a reformer for a fuel cell and the like in which a catalyst function is used, a trap filter such as diesel particulate filter (hereinafter referred to as ??dpf)?? of fine particles in an exhaust gas, particularly diesel fine particles and the like.
the dpf as one type of filter is incorporated in the exhaust system of a diesel engine to trap and remove particulates included in the exhaust gas from the diesel engine or the like. examples of a material forming the trap filter typified by this dpf include a ceramic, a metal and an alloy. as a typical example of the filter made of the ceramic, a honeycomb filter made of cordierite, silicon carbide, silicon nitride or aluminum titanate is known. in particular, a honeycomb structure filter including porous honeycomb segments formed of a sintered body of silicon carbide or silicon nitride has an advantage that thermal resistance, strength and thermal conductivity are high, whereas there has been a problem that the filter has low thermal shock. in consequence, as the filter is large, crack is easily generated in the filter. therefore, in recent years, as means for avoiding damage due to the crack, a technology has been suggested in which a plurality of porous honeycomb segments are integrated to manufacture one large ceramic structure (e.g., patent document 1).
this honeycomb structure has a constitution in which a plurality of porous honeycomb segments made of silicon carbide or the like are bonded to one another with a bonding material, processed into a predetermined shape such as a circular sectional shape, and then coated with a coating material. each of the honeycomb segments has a large number of through holes which are separated by porous partition walls and which extend through the structure in an axial direction. the ends of the adjacent through holes are alternately plugged. the end of one through hole on the one side is opened, whereas the end thereof on the other side is plugged. the end of the other through hole adjacent to the one through hole on the other side is plugged, but the end of the other through hole on the one side is opened. according to such a constitution, when the exhaust gas flows into the through hole from the opened end, the exhaust gas passes through the porous partition wall and is discharged from the other through hole. when the gas passes through the partition wall, particulates in the exhaust gas are trapped by the partition wall, so that the exhaust gas can be purified.
in this honeycomb structure, deposited soot is burnt and gasified, whereby the filter is regenerated, and the particulates in the exhaust gas can be trapped again.
however, when the ceramic structure is used as the filter, there has been a problem that the fine particles trapped in the filter are not completely burnt, and easily partially remain unburnt. therefore, the conventional honeycomb structure has a poor efficiency in treating the exhaust gas.
it is considered that a cause for the occurrence of such a problem lies in that thermal conduction between the filters is disturbed to make a temperature difference in the ceramic structure, and a ceramic filter assembly is suggested in which the thermal conduction between the filters is not easily disturbed to provide equally an excellent heat distribution.
for example, it is suggested that the thermal conductivity of the bonding material is defined to decrease a maximum temperature difference between an inner segment and an outer segment, but it is difficult to decrease a temperature difference between the center of the outer segment and the vicinity of an outer periphery coating material (e.g., patent document 2). therefore, there remains unsolved a problem that the temperature in the vicinity of the coating material of the outer segment does not easily rise and that the soot of the corresponding portion is not easily completely burnt.
in particular, there remains unsolved a problem that the temperature in the vicinity of the outer periphery coating material of the outer segment does not easily rise in the honeycomb segment having a high porosity (a low thermal conductivity) as compared with the honeycomb segment having a high thermal conductivity.
on the other hand, it is suggested that the ratio of the thermal conductivity of the coating material with respect to the thermal conductivity of the bonding material is defined as 0.1 to 0.8 to decrease the maximum temperature difference between the inner segment and the outer segment and to improve the insulation property of the honeycomb structure. however, the porosity of the coating material is increased to decrease the thermal conductivity of the coating material, so that a problem that the strength of the coating material lowers and that the coating material is cracked remains unsolved (e.g., patent document 3).

a honeycomb structure made of a ceramic has been used in a catalyst carrier for an internal combustion engine, a boiler, a chemical reaction device, a reformer for a fuel cell and the like in which a catalyst function is used, a trap filter such as diesel particulate filter (hereinafter referred to as ??dpf)?? of fine particles in an exhaust gas, particularly diesel fine particles and the like.
the dpf as one type of filter is incorporated in the exhaust system of a diesel engine to trap and remove particulates included in the exhaust gas from the diesel engine or the like. examples of a material forming the trap filter typified by this dpf include a ceramic, a metal and an alloy. as a typical example of the filter made of the ceramic, a honeycomb filter made of cordierite, silicon carbide, silicon nitride or aluminum titanate is known. in particular, a honeycomb structure filter including porous honeycomb segments formed of a sintered body of silicon carbide or silicon nitride has an advantage that thermal resistance, strength and thermal conductivity are high, whereas there has been a problem that the filter has low thermal shock. in consequence, as the filter is large, crack is easily generated in the filter. therefore, in recent years, as means for avoiding damage due to the crack, a technology has been suggested in which a plurality of porous honeycomb segments are integrated to manufacture one large ceramic structure (e.g., patent document 1).
this honeycomb structure has a constitution in which a plurality of porous honeycomb segments made of silicon carbide or the like are bonded to one another with a bonding material, processed into a predetermined shape such as a circular sectional shape, and then coated with a coating material. each of the honeycomb segments has a large number of through holes which are separated by porous partition walls and which extend through the structure in an axial direction. the ends of the adjacent through holes are alternately plugged. the end of one through hole on the one side is opened, whereas the end thereof on the other side is plugged. the end of the other through hole adjacent to the one through hole on the other side is plugged, but the end of the other through hole on the one side is opened. according to such a constitution, when the exhaust gas flows into the through hole from the opened end, the exhaust gas passes through the porous partition wall and is discharged from the other through hole. when the gas passes through the partition wall, particulates in the exhaust gas are trapped by the partition wall, so that the exhaust gas can be purified.
in this honeycomb structure, deposited soot is burnt and gasified, whereby the filter is regenerated, and the particulates in the exhaust gas can be trapped again.
however, when the ceramic structure is used as the filter, there has been a problem that the fine particles trapped in the filter are not completely burnt, and easily partially remain unburnt. therefore, the conventional honeycomb structure has a poor efficiency in treating the exhaust gas.
it is considered that a cause for the occurrence of such a problem lies in that thermal conduction between the filters is disturbed to make a temperature difference in the ceramic structure, and a ceramic filter assembly is suggested in which the thermal conduction between the filters is not easily disturbed to provide equally an excellent heat distribution.
for example, it is suggested that the thermal conductivity of the bonding material is defined to decrease a maximum temperature difference between an inner segment and an outer segment, but it is difficult to decrease a temperature difference between the center of the outer segment and the vicinity of an outer periphery coating material (e.g., patent document 2). therefore, there remains unsolved a problem that the temperature in the vicinity of the coating material of the outer segment does not easily rise and that the soot of the corresponding portion is not easily completely burnt.
in particular, there remains unsolved a problem that the temperature in the vicinity of the outer periphery coating material of the outer segment does not easily rise in the honeycomb segment having a high porosity (a low thermal conductivity) as compared with the honeycomb segment having a high thermal conductivity.
on the other hand, it is suggested that the ratio of the thermal conductivity of the coating material with respect to the thermal conductivity of the bonding material is defined as 0.1 to 0.8 to decrease the maximum temperature difference between the inner segment and the outer segment and to improve the insulation property of the honeycomb structure. however, the porosity of the coating material is increased to decrease the thermal conductivity of the coating material, so that a problem that the strength of the coating material lowers and that the coating material is cracked remains unsolved (e.g., patent document 3).

a honeycomb structure made of a ceramic has been used in a catalyst carrier for an internal combustion engine, a boiler, a chemical reaction device, a reformer for a fuel cell and the like in which a catalyst function is used, a trap filter such as diesel particulate filter (hereinafter referred to as ??dpf)?? of fine particles in an exhaust gas, particularly diesel fine particles and the like.
the dpf as one type of filter is incorporated in the exhaust system of a diesel engine to trap and remove particulates included in the exhaust gas from the diesel engine or the like. examples of a material forming the trap filter typified by this dpf include a ceramic, a metal and an alloy. as a typical example of the filter made of the ceramic, a honeycomb filter made of cordierite, silicon carbide, silicon nitride or aluminum titanate is known. in particular, a honeycomb structure filter including porous honeycomb segments formed of a sintered body of silicon carbide or silicon nitride has an advantage that thermal resistance, strength and thermal conductivity are high, whereas there has been a problem that the filter has low thermal shock. in consequence, as the filter is large, crack is easily generated in the filter. therefore, in recent years, as means for avoiding damage due to the crack, a technology has been suggested in which a plurality of porous honeycomb segments are integrated to manufacture one large ceramic structure (e.g., patent document 1).
this honeycomb structure has a constitution in which a plurality of porous honeycomb segments made of silicon carbide or the like are bonded to one another with a bonding material, processed into a predetermined shape such as a circular sectional shape, and then coated with a coating material. each of the honeycomb segments has a large number of through holes which are separated by porous partition walls and which extend through the structure in an axial direction. the ends of the adjacent through holes are alternately plugged. the end of one through hole on the one side is opened, whereas the end thereof on the other side is plugged. the end of the other through hole adjacent to the one through hole on the other side is plugged, but the end of the other through hole on the one side is opened. according to such a constitution, when the exhaust gas flows into the through hole from the opened end, the exhaust gas passes through the porous partition wall and is discharged from the other through hole. when the gas passes through the partition wall, particulates in the exhaust gas are trapped by the partition wall, so that the exhaust gas can be purified.
in this honeycomb structure, deposited soot is burnt and gasified, whereby the filter is regenerated, and the particulates in the exhaust gas can be trapped again.
however, when the ceramic structure is used as the filter, there has been a problem that the fine particles trapped in the filter are not completely burnt, and easily partially remain unburnt. therefore, the conventional honeycomb structure has a poor efficiency in treating the exhaust gas.
it is considered that a cause for the occurrence of such a problem lies in that thermal conduction between the filters is disturbed to make a temperature difference in the ceramic structure, and a ceramic filter assembly is suggested in which the thermal conduction between the filters is not easily disturbed to provide equally an excellent heat distribution.
for example, it is suggested that the thermal conductivity of the bonding material is defined to decrease a maximum temperature difference between an inner segment and an outer segment, but it is difficult to decrease a temperature difference between the center of the outer segment and the vicinity of an outer periphery coating material (e.g., patent document 2). therefore, there remains unsolved a problem that the temperature in the vicinity of the coating material of the outer segment does not easily rise and that the soot of the corresponding portion is not easily completely burnt.
in particular, there remains unsolved a problem that the temperature in the vicinity of the outer periphery coating material of the outer segment does not easily rise in the honeycomb segment having a high porosity (a low thermal conductivity) as compared with the honeycomb segment having a high thermal conductivity.
on the other hand, it is suggested that the ratio of the thermal conductivity of the coating material with respect to the thermal conductivity of the bonding material is defined as 0.1 to 0.8 to decrease the maximum temperature difference between the inner segment and the outer segment and to improve the insulation property of the honeycomb structure. however, the porosity of the coating material is increased to decrease the thermal conductivity of the coating material, so that a problem that the strength of the coating material lowers and that the coating material is cracked remains unsolved (e.g., patent document 3).

US07673446,dual path exhaust emission control system,"an exhaust emission control system for an internal combustion engine is disclosed. the exhaust emission control system has a first passageway and a second passageway disposed to receive exhaust in parallel. the exhaust emission control system also has a valve arrangement configured to regulate the flow of exhaust to the first and second passageways, and at least one sensor configured to sense a parameter indicative of a constituent of the exhaust. the at least one sensor generates a signal corresponding to the sensed parameter. the exhaust emission control system also has a controller in communication with the valve and the at least one sensor. the controller is configured to affect operation of the valve in response to the signal.","this disclosure relates generally to an exhaust emission control system, and more particularly, to an exhaust emission control system employing a dual path flow for purifying exhaust gas discharge.
engines, including diesel engines, gasoline engines, gaseous fuel-powered engines, and other engines known in the art exhaust a complex mixture of emissions. these emissions may be composed of gaseous compounds, including no, no2, co, co2, unburned hydrocarbons cxhy, water vapor, o2, and solid carbon particulate matter also known as soot.
the amount of gaseous compounds emitted to the atmosphere from an engine may be regulated depending on the type of engine, size of engine, and/or class of engine. a method implemented by engine manufacturers to comply with the regulation of particulate matter exhausted to the environment includes removing the particulate matter from the exhaust flow of an engine with a device called a particulate trap. another method that has been implemented by engine manufacturers to comply with the regulation of engine emissions has been to employ various catalysts to purify the exhaust gas from the engine before emitting the gas to the atmosphere. most catalysts either employ conventional lean nox mechanisms or on-board ammonia production by urea hydrolysis, known as urea selective catalytic reduction. these mechanisms seek to convert harmful nox into innocuous constituents such as n2, co2, and water, and to neutralize or eliminate nh3 slip attributed to the urea selective catalytic reduction aftertreatment system.
one example of utilizing lean nox mechanisms to purify exhaust emissions is described in u.s. pat. no. 6,378,298 (the '298 patent) issued to harima et al. on apr. 30, 2002. the '298 patent utilizes a conventional lean nox catalyst to purify the exhaust gas. specifically, the '298 patent describes a split exhaust flow including a first passageway and a second passageway that both allow exhaust gas to flow from the engine to the catalyst. the '298 patent further discloses a flow controller that controls the amount of exhaust gas flowing from the engine through the first and second passageways based on a temperature of the exhaust gas. the first passageway contains an accelerated cooling portion having a cross section designed to allow a large release of heat from the exhaust gas in the first passageway. the second passageway has a cross section designed to allow a small release of heat from the exhaust gas in the second passageway. the amount of exhaust gas flowing through the first passageway is made larger than that through the second passageway when the temperature of exhaust gas emitted from the engine is to be lowered by a relatively large degree before reaching the catalyst. in contrast, the amount of exhaust gas flowing through the second passageway is made larger than that through the first passageway when the temperature of exhaust gas emitted from the engine is to be lowered by only a small degree before reaching the catalyst.
although the exhaust purifying system of the '298 patent may reduce the amount of nox gas exhausted to the environment, it relies exclusively on lean nox mechanisms to purify exhaust emissions. thus, the system described in the '298 patent will be ineffective in situations where lean nox mechanisms alone cannot sufficiently convert harmful emissions into innocuous constituents.
